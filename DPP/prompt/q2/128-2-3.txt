To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the bachelor's degree restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Partial Solution: 
| subjects                      | semesters  | credits | compulsory | 
|-------------------------------|------------|---------|------------| 
| Programming Fundamentals      | 1 (Autumn) | 10      | Yes        | 
| Programming Techniques        | 2 (Spring) | 10      | Yes        | 
| Operating Systems Programming | 3 (Autumn) | 10      | Yes        |
