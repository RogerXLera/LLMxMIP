The bachelor's degree planning problem is the problem of finding a planning of university subjects that respect some precedence and university restrictions while maximising the skills learnt. Specifically, the goal is to acquire the required level for the student's desired job role by coursing subjects. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 6-semester bachelor's degree planning problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the bachelor's degree restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Partial Solution: 
| subjects                    | semesters  | credits | compulsory | 
|-----------------------------|------------|---------|------------| 
| Discrete Mathematics        | 3 (Autumn) | 10      | No         | 
| Formal Software Engineering | 6 (Spring) | 10      | No         | 

Question: Why is Discrete Mathematics planned? 
Reasons: 
0: Discrete Mathematics is planned 
1: Discrete Mathematics must be planned before Formal Software Engineering 
2: Level 3 of skill Software Design is acquired by coursing Object Oriented Analysis, Formal Software Engineering, Human-Computer Interaction,  or Systems Analysis and Design 
3: Formal Software Engineering cannot be planned during autumn semesters 
4: reduce the percentage of skills learnt below 64%  
5: Level 3 of skill Requirement Definition and Management is acquired by coursing Object Oriented Analysis,  or Systems Analysis and Design 
6: There is no course that teaches level 1 of skill Business Analysis 
7: There is no course that teaches level 2 of skill Business Analysis 
8: There is no course that teaches level 3 of skill Business Analysis
