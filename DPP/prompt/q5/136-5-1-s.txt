The bachelor's degree planning problem is the problem of finding a planning of university subjects that respect some precedence and university restrictions while maximising the skills learnt. Specifically, the goal is to acquire the required level for the student's desired job role by coursing subjects. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 6-semester bachelor's degree planning problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the bachelor's degree restrictions. 
Partial Solution: 
| subjects                       | semesters  | credits | compulsory | 
|--------------------------------|------------|---------|------------| 
| Data Structures and Algorithms | 5 (Autumn) | 10      | No         | 
| Artificial Intelligence        | 6 (Spring) | 10      | No         | 

Question: Why is Data Structures and Algorithms planned? 
Reasons: 
0: Data Structures and Algorithms is planned 
1: Formal Software Engineering cannot be planned during autumn semesters 
2: Artificial Intelligence cannot be planned during autumn semesters 
3: Data Structures and Algorithms must be planned before Formal Software Engineering 
4: Data Structures and Algorithms must be planned before Artificial Intelligence
