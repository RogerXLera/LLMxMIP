To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the bachelor's degree restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Partial Solution: 
| subjects                 | semesters  | credits | compulsory | 
|--------------------------|------------|---------|------------| 
| Applications of Big Data | 4 (Spring) | 10      | No         | 

Question: Why is Applications of Big Data planned?
