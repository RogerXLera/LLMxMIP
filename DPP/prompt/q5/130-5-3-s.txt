The bachelor's degree planning problem is the problem of finding a planning of university subjects that respect some precedence and university restrictions while maximising the skills learnt. Specifically, the goal is to acquire the required level for the student's desired job role by coursing subjects. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 6-semester bachelor's degree planning problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the bachelor's degree restrictions. 
Partial Solution: 
| subjects                           | semesters  | credits | compulsory | 
|------------------------------------|------------|---------|------------| 
| Introduction to Health Informatics | 2 (Spring) | 10      | No         | 
| Healthcare Data Environments       | 4 (Spring) | 10      | No         | 

Question: Why is Introduction to Health Informatics planned? 
Reasons: 
0: Introduction to Health Informatics is planned 
1: Fundamentals of Medical Concepts and Terminology cannot be planned during spring semesters 
2: Clinical Classification and Coding cannot be planned during spring semesters 
3: Healthcare Data Environments cannot be planned during autumn semesters 
4: Introduction to Health Informatics must be planned before Fundamentals of Medical Concepts and Terminology 
5: Fundamentals of Medical Concepts and Terminology must be planned before Clinical Classification and Coding 
6: Introduction to Health Informatics must be planned before Healthcare Data Environments
