In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 6-semester bachelor's degree planning problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the bachelor's degree restrictions. 
Partial Solution: 
| subjects                    | semesters  | credits | compulsory | 
|-----------------------------|------------|---------|------------| 
| Formal Software Engineering | 6 (Spring) | 10      | No         | 

Question: Why is Formal Software Engineering planned? 
Reasons: 
0: Formal Software Engineering is planned 
1: Level 3 of skill Requirement Definition and Management is acquired by coursing Object Oriented Analysis,  or Systems Analysis and Design 
2: There is no course that teaches level 1 of skill Business Analysis 
3: There is no course that teaches level 2 of skill Business Analysis 
4: There is no course that teaches level 3 of skill Business Analysis 
5: Level 3 of skill Software Design is acquired by coursing Object Oriented Analysis, Formal Software Engineering, Human-Computer Interaction,  or Systems Analysis and Design 
6: reduce the percentage of skills learnt below 64%  

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
