The bachelor's degree planning problem is the problem of finding a planning of university subjects that respect some precedence and university restrictions while maximising the skills learnt. Specifically, the goal is to acquire the required level for the student's desired job role by coursing subjects. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 6-semester bachelor's degree planning problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the bachelor's degree restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Partial Solution: 
| subjects                       | semesters  | credits | compulsory | 
|--------------------------------|------------|---------|------------| 
| Statistical Decision Making    | 1 (Autumn) | 10      | Yes        | 
| Object Oriented Programming    | 4 (Spring) | 10      | No         | 
| Data Structures and Algorithms | 5 (Autumn) | 10      | No         | 
| Programming Techniques         | 6 (Spring) | 10      | Yes        | 

Question: Why is Statistical Decision Making planned at semester 1 instead of Data Structures and Algorithms? 
Reasons: 
0: Statistical Decision Making is planned at semester 1 instead of course Data Structures and Algorithms 
1: Object Oriented Programming,  or Programming Techniques must be planned before Data Structures and Algorithms 
Connections: 
(0-1) 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
