The bachelor's degree planning problem is the problem of finding a bachelor's degree plan of university subjects that respect some precedence and university restrictions (e.g., subjects can only be completed once, subjects are offered in particular semesters, there are compulsory subjects, and not to plan more than 40 credits per semester) while maximising the skills learnt. Specifically, the goal is to acquire the required level for the student's desired job role by coursing subjects. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 6-semester bachelor's degree planning problem. To do so, reason about the provided solution and the restrictions of a bachelor's degree. 
Solution: 
| subjects                                   | semesters  | offered                | predecessors                                                                                 | compulsory | preferred job skills (level) |
