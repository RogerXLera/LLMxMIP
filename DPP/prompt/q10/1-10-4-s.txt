The bachelor's degree planning problem is the problem of finding a planning of university subjects that respect some precedence and university restrictions while maximising the skills learnt. Specifically, the goal is to acquire the required level for the student's desired job role by coursing subjects. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 6-semester bachelor's degree planning problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the bachelor's degree restrictions. 
Partial Solution: 
| subjects                 | semesters  | credits | compulsory | 
|--------------------------|------------|---------|------------| 
| Applications of Big Data | 4 (Spring) | 10      | No         | 

Question: Why is Applications of Big Data planned instead of Networked Systems Design? 
Reasons: 
0: Applications of Big Data is planned instead of Networked Systems Design 
1: There is no course that teaches level 1 of skill Capacity Management 
2: There is no course that teaches level 2 of skill Capacity Management 
3: There is no course that teaches level 3 of skill Capacity Management 
4: There is no course that teaches level 4 of skill Capacity Management 
5: There is no course that teaches level 1 of skill Problem Management 
6: There is no course that teaches level 2 of skill Problem Management 
7: There is no course that teaches level 3 of skill Problem Management 
8: There is no course that teaches level 4 of skill Problem Management 
9: There is no course that teaches level 1 of skill Availability Management 
10: There is no course that teaches level 2 of skill Availability Management 
11: There is no course that teaches level 3 of skill Availability Management 
12: There is no course that teaches level 4 of skill Availability Management 
13: There is no course that teaches level 5 of skill Availability Management 
14: Level 5 of skill Systems Design is acquired by coursing Object Oriented Analysis, Information Systems in Context, Professional Experience, Systems Analysis and Design, Healthcare Software and Systems,  or Cloud Computing Architecture 
15: Level 3 of skill IT Infrastructure is acquired by coursing Distributed Systems and Programming, Applications of Big Data,  or Introduction to Cloud Computing  
16: Level 4 of skill IT Infrastructure is acquired by coursing Distributed Systems and Programming, Applications of Big Data,  or Introduction to Cloud Computing  
17: Level 3 of skill Systems Installation/decommissioning is acquired by coursing PC Workshop 
18: Level 4 of skill Systems Installation/decommissioning is acquired by coursing PC Workshop 
19: Level 5 of skill Systems Installation/decommissioning is acquired by coursing PC Workshop 
20: reduce the percentage of skills learnt below 40%  

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
