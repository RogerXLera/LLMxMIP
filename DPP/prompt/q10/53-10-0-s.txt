The bachelor's degree planning problem is the problem of finding a planning of university subjects that respect some precedence and university restrictions while maximising the skills learnt. Specifically, the goal is to acquire the required level for the student's desired job role by coursing subjects. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 6-semester bachelor's degree planning problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the bachelor's degree restrictions. 
Partial Solution: 
| subjects                           | semesters  | credits | compulsory | 
|------------------------------------|------------|---------|------------| 
| Introduction to Health Informatics | 2 (Spring) | 10      | No         | 
| Healthcare Data Environments       | 4 (Spring) | 10      | No         | 

Question: Why is Introduction to Health Informatics planned instead of Environmental Informatics? 
Reasons: 
0: Introduction to Health Informatics is planned instead of Environmental Informatics 
1: Fundamentals of Medical Concepts and Terminology cannot be planned during spring semesters 
2: Clinical Classification and Coding cannot be planned during spring semesters 
3: Healthcare Data Environments cannot be planned during autumn semesters 
4: Introduction to Health Informatics must be planned before Fundamentals of Medical Concepts and Terminology 
5: Fundamentals of Medical Concepts and Terminology must be planned before Clinical Classification and Coding 
6: Introduction to Health Informatics must be planned before Healthcare Data Environments

8: Level 5 of skill Specialist Advice is acquired by coursing LAN Workshop, Operating Systems Programming, Statistical Decision Making, Video Games Development, Advanced Clinical Classification, Predictive Modelling, Cloud Computing Architecture,  or Robotic Programming 
9: There is no course that teaches level 1 of skill Quality Assurance 
10: There is no course that teaches level 2 of skill Quality Assurance 
11: There is no course that teaches level 3 of skill Quality Assurance 
12: There is no course that teaches level 4 of skill Quality Assurance 
13: Level 4 of skill User Experience Analysis is acquired by coursing Human-Computer Interaction 
14: Level 3 of skill Testing is acquired by coursing Data Structures and Algorithms, Internet Programming, Systems Programming 1, Programming Fundamentals, Programming Techniques, Web Systems Development, Video Games Development,  or Mobile Applications Development 
15: Level 4 of skill Testing is acquired by coursing Data Structures and Algorithms, Internet Programming, Systems Programming 1, Programming Fundamentals, Programming Techniques, Web Systems Development, Video Games Development,  or Mobile Applications Development 
16: Level 1 of skill Conformance Review is acquired by coursing Clinical Classification and Coding,  or Healthcare Data Environments 
17: Level 2 of skill Conformance Review is acquired by coursing Clinical Classification and Coding,  or Healthcare Data Environments 
18: Level 3 of skill Conformance Review is acquired by coursing Clinical Classification and Coding,  or Healthcare Data Environments 
19: Level 4 of skill Conformance Review is acquired by coursing Clinical Classification and Coding,  or Healthcare Data Environments 
20: Level 4 of skill User Experience Evaluation is acquired by coursing Human-Computer Interaction 
21: reduce the percentage of skills learnt below 59%
