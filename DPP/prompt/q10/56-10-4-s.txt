The bachelor's degree planning problem is the problem of finding a planning of university subjects that respect some precedence and university restrictions while maximising the skills learnt. Specifically, the goal is to acquire the required level for the student's desired job role by coursing subjects. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 6-semester bachelor's degree planning problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the bachelor's degree restrictions. 
Partial Solution: 
| subjects                    | semesters  | credits | compulsory | 
|-----------------------------|------------|---------|------------| 
| Formal Software Engineering | 6 (Spring) | 10      | No         | 

Question: Why is Formal Software Engineering planned instead of Object Oriented Programming? 
Reasons: 
0: Formal Software Engineering is planned instead of Object Oriented Programming 
1: Level 4 of skill User Experience Design is acquired by coursing Human-Computer Interaction 
2: There is no course that teaches level 1 of skill User Research 
3: There is no course that teaches level 2 of skill User Research 
4: There is no course that teaches level 3 of skill User Research 
5: There is no course that teaches level 4 of skill User Research 
6: Level 3 of skill Software Design is acquired by coursing Object Oriented Analysis, Formal Software Engineering, Human-Computer Interaction,  or Systems Analysis and Design 
7: reduce the percentage of skills learnt below 71%  

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
