Specifically, the goal is to acquire the required level for the student's desired job role by coursing subjects. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 6-semester bachelor's degree planning problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the bachelor's degree restrictions. 
Partial Solution: 
| subjects                       | semesters  | credits | compulsory | 
|--------------------------------|------------|---------|------------| 
| Programming Techniques         | 2 (Spring) | 10      | Yes        | 
| Data Structures and Algorithms | 3 (Autumn) | 10      | No         | 
| Formal Software Engineering    | 4 (Spring) | 10      | No         | 

Question: Why is Formal Software Engineering not planned before semester 4? 
Reasons: 
0: Formal Software Engineering is not planned before semester 4 
1: Formal Software Engineering cannot be planned during autumn semesters 
2: Object Oriented Programming,  or Programming Techniques must be planned before Data Structures and Algorithms 
3: Data Structures and Algorithms must be planned before Formal Software Engineering 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
