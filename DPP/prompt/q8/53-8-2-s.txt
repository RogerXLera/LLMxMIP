Partial Solution: 
| subjects                      | semesters  | credits | compulsory | 
|-------------------------------|------------|---------|------------| 
| Programming Fundamentals      | 1 (Autumn) | 10      | Yes        | 
| Programming Techniques        | 4 (Spring) | 10      | Yes        | 
| Operating Systems Programming | 5 (Autumn) | 10      | Yes        | 

Question: Why is the subset of courses Operating Systems Programming, Programming Fundamentals not planned at semester 5? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of courses Operating Systems Programming, Programming Fundamentals is not planned at semester 5 
1: Programming Fundamentals cannot be planned more than ones 
2: Object Oriented Programming cannot be planned during autumn semesters 
3: Programming Techniques cannot be planned during autumn semesters 
4: Programming Fundamentals must be planned before Object Oriented Programming 
5: Programming Fundamentals must be planned before Programming Techniques 
6: Programming Techniques,  or Object Oriented Programming must be planned before Operating Systems Programming
