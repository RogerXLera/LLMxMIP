Partial Solution: 
| subjects                         | semesters  | credits | compulsory | 
|----------------------------------|------------|---------|------------| 
| Computer Networking              | 2 (Spring) | 10      | Yes        | 
| Introduction to Cloud Computing  | 3 (Autumn) | 10      | No         | 
| Cloud Computing Architecture     | 4 (Spring) | 10      | No         | 

Question: Why is the subset of courses Cloud Computing Architecture, Computer Networking not planned at semester 4? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of courses Cloud Computing Architecture, Computer Networking is not planned at semester 4 
1: Computer Networking cannot be planned more than ones 
2: Introduction to Cloud Computing  cannot be planned during spring semesters 
3: Computer Networking must be planned before Introduction to Cloud Computing  
4: Introduction to Cloud Computing  must be planned before Cloud Computing Architecture 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
