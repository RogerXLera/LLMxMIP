The bachelor's degree planning problem is the problem of finding a planning of university subjects that respect some precedence and university restrictions while maximising the skills learnt. Specifically, the goal is to acquire the required level for the student's desired job role by coursing subjects. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 6-semester bachelor's degree planning problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the bachelor's degree restrictions. 
Partial Solution: 
| subjects                | semesters  | credits | compulsory | 
|-------------------------|------------|---------|------------| 
| Discrete Mathematics    | 3 (Autumn) | 10      | No         | 
| Professional Experience | 6 (Spring) | 10      | Yes        | 

Question: Why is the subset of courses Professional Experience, Discrete Mathematics not planned at semester 6? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of courses Professional Experience, Discrete Mathematics is not planned at semester 6 
1: Discrete Mathematics cannot be planned during spring semesters 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
