The bachelor's degree planning problem is the problem of finding a planning of university subjects that respect some precedence and university restrictions while maximising the skills learnt. Specifically, the goal is to acquire the required level for the student's desired job role by coursing subjects. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 6-semester bachelor's degree planning problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the bachelor's degree restrictions. 
Partial Solution: 
| subjects                      | semesters  | credits | compulsory | 
|-------------------------------|------------|---------|------------| 
| Programming Fundamentals      | 1 (Autumn) | 10      | Yes        | 
| Object Oriented Programming   | 2 (Spring) | 10      | No         | 
| Analysis of Change            | 4 (Spring) | 10      | No         | 
| Operating Systems Programming | 5 (Autumn) | 10      | Yes        | 
| Programming Techniques        | 6 (Spring) | 10      | Yes        | 

Question: Why is the subset of courses Analysis of Change, Programming Fundamentals not planned at semester 4? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of courses Analysis of Change, Programming Fundamentals is not planned at semester 4 
1: Programming Fundamentals cannot be planned more than ones 
2: Object Oriented Programming cannot be planned during autumn semesters 
3: Programming Techniques cannot be planned during autumn semesters 
4: Operating Systems Programming cannot be planned during spring semesters 
5: Programming Fundamentals must be planned before Object Oriented Programming 
6: Programming Fundamentals must be planned before Programming Techniques 
7: Programming Techniques,  or Object Oriented Programming must be planned before Operating Systems Programming 
8: Operating Systems Programming is compulsory 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
