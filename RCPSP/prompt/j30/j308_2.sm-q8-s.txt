PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 7        | 18         | 23              | 6        | 6            | 1             | 1              |

Question: Why is the subset of activities 7, 12, 16, 13, 23 not completed at the same time period? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 7, 12, 16, 13, 23 is not completed at the same time period 
1: activity 13 must be completed before starting activity 17 
2: activity 17 must be completed before starting activity 24 
3: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 26 
4: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 27 
5: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 30 
6: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
7: extends the length of the project beyond time period 51 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
