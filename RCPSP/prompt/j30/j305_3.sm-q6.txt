PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 8        | 26         | 33              | 8        | 6            | 1             | 3              | 
| 9        | 31         | 33              | 3        | 7            | 1             | 2              | 
| 13       | 25         | 33              | 9        | 10           | 1             | 1              | 
| 22       | 34         | 36              | 3        | 8, 18        | 1             | 6              | 
Question: Why is the subset of activities 22, 8, 9, 13 not completed at time period 36? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 22, 8, 9, 13 is not completed at time period 36 
1: activity 22 must be completed 
2: activity 8 must be completed before starting activity 22

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason. 

OUTPUT:
