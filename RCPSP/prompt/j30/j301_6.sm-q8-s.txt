PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 2        | 1          | 10              | 10       | 1            | 4             | 4              | 
| 3        | 13         | 13              | 1        | 1            | 4             | 10             | 
| 5        | 11         | 13              | 3        | 2            | 1             | 6              | 
| 11       | 17         | 22              | 6        | 3            | 3             | 10             | 
| 15       | 14         | 16              | 3        | 5            | 4             | 6              | 
| 16       | 23         | 23              | 1        | 4, 11, 15    | 3             | 10             | 
| 19       | 24         | 24              | 1        | 16           | 2             | 6              | 
Question: Why is the subset of activities 19, 16 not completed at the same time period? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 19, 16 is not completed at the same time period 
1: activity 2 must be completed 
2: activity 3 must be completed 
3: activity 19 must be completed 
4: activity 2 must be completed before starting activity 5 
5: activity 3 must be completed before starting activity 11 
6: activity 5 must be completed before starting activity 15 
7: activity 11 must be completed before starting activity 16 
8: activity 15 must be completed before starting activity 16 
9: activity 16 must be completed before starting activity 19 
10: resource 4 is scarce at time period 1 due to activities 2, 3 
11: resource 4 is scarce at time period 2 due to activities 2, 3 
12: resource 4 is scarce at time period 3 due to activities 2, 3 
13: resource 4 is scarce at time period 4 due to activities 2, 3 
14: resource 4 is scarce at time period 5 due to activities 2, 3 
15: resource 4 is scarce at time period 6 due to activities 2, 3 
16: resource 4 is scarce at time period 7 due to activities 2, 3 
17: resource 4 is scarce at time period 8 due to activities 2, 3 
18: resource 4 is scarce at time period 9 due to activities 2, 3 
19: resource 4 is scarce at time period 10 due to activities 2, 3 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
