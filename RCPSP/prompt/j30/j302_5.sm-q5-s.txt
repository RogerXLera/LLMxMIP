PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 21       | 25         | 32              | 8        | 10, 13       | 4             | 5              | 
| 24       | 43         | 50              | 8        | 5, 20        | 4             | 7              | 
| 26       | 39         | 48              | 10       | 20, 21, 23   | 3             | 1              | 
| 27       | 34         | 42              | 9        | 19, 22       | 4             | 5              | 
| 28       | 49         | 49              | 1        | 18, 26       | 3             | 8              | 
| 30       | 43         | 51              | 9        | 17, 25, 27   | 1             | 2              | 
| 31       | 51         | 51              | 1        | 24, 25, 28   | 2             | 6              | 
| 32       | 51         | 51              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is the subset of activities 30, 31, 32 completed at time period 51? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 30, 31, 32 is completed at time period 51 
1: activity 21 must be completed 
2: activity 24 must be completed 
3: activity 27 must be completed 
4: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 26 
5: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 28 
6: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 30 
7: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 31 
8: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 31 
9: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
10: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
11: resource 4 is scarce at time period 26 due to activities 21, 24, 6 
12: resource 4 is scarce at time period 31 due to activities 21, 24, 6 
13: resource 4 is scarce at time period 34 due to activities 21, 24, 27, 6 
14: resource 4 is scarce at time period 42 due to activities 21, 24, 27, 6 
15: extends the length of the project beyond time period 51 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
