PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units |

Question: Why is activity 25 completed at time period 30 instead of time period 29? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 25 is completed at time period 30 instead of time period 29 
1: activity 25 must be completed 
2: activity 17 must be completed before starting activity 25 
3: activity 9 must be completed before starting activity 17 
4: activity 8 must be completed before starting activity 9 
5: resource 1 is scarce at time period 14 due to activities 11, 18, 3, 4, 6, 9 
6: activity 5 must be completed before starting activity 8 
7: activity 3 must be completed 
8: activity 4 must be completed 
9: activity 4 must be completed before starting activity 5 
10: activity 3 must be completed before starting activity 11 
11: activity 11 must be completed before starting activity 14 
12: resource 1 is scarce at time period 4 due to activities 3, 4 
13: activity 14 must be completed before starting activity 21 
14: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 29 
15: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
16: extends the length of the project beyond time period 42
