PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 11       | 11         | 15              | 5        | 7            | 1             | 4              | 
| 13       | 16         | 23              | 8        | 7            | 2             | 6              | 
| 20       | 26         | 33              | 8        | 6            | 1             | 5              | 
| 21       | 25         | 26              | 2        | 11, 18       | 1             | 2              | 
| 25       | 27         | 33              | 7        | 13           | 2             | 4              | 
Question: Why is the subset of activities 20, 25, 21 not completed at the same time period? 
Reasons:
