PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 17       | 33         | 36              | 4        | 13, 14       | 2             | 8              | 
| 25       | 37         | 40              | 4        | 11, 17, 20   | 4             | 8              | 
| 28       | 29         | 32              | 4        | 23           | 2             | 6              | 
| 30       | 34         | 43              | 10       | 5, 22, 28    | 3             | 9              | 
| 32       | 43         | 43              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is activity 25 completed at time period 40 instead of time period 39? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 25 is completed at time period 40 instead of time period 39 
1: activity 17 must be completed 
2: activity 25 must be completed 
3: activity 28 must be completed 
4: activity 17 must be completed before starting activity 25 
5: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 30 
6: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
7: resource 2 is scarce at time period 30 due to activities 12, 17, 19, 2, 20, 21, 24, 28, 3, 31, 6, 7 
8: resource 2 is scarce at time period 32 due to activities 12, 17, 19, 2, 20, 21, 24, 28, 3, 31, 6, 7 
9: extends the length of the project beyond time period 43 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
