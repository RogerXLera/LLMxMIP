PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 21       | 23         | 31              | 9        | 16           | 1             | 10             | 
| 22       | 32         | 35              | 4        | 20           | 4             | 10             | 
| 24       | 32         | 37              | 6        | 15, 21       | 1             | 5              | 
| 26       | 36         | 42              | 7        | 13, 15       | 2             | 3              | 
| 27       | 38         | 38              | 1        | 7, 17, 24    | 1             | 4              | 
| 29       | 43         | 46              | 4        | 11, 26, 28   | 1             | 6              | 
| 30       | 39         | 43              | 5        | 18, 22, 27   | 2             | 2              | 
| 32       | 46         | 46              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is the subset of activities 29, 32 completed at the same time period? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 29, 32 is completed at the same time period 
1: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 29 
2: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
3: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
4: extends the length of the project beyond time period 46 
5: activity 26 must be completed 
6: resource 4 is scarce at time period 31 due to activities 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21, 26, 3, 8, 9 
7: resource 4 is scarce at time period 35 due to activities 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 26, 29, 3, 8, 9 
8: resource 4 is scarce at time period 38 due to activities 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 26, 29, 3, 8, 9 
9: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 30 
10: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 30 
11: activity 21 must be completed 
12: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 24 
13: activity 22 must be completed 
14: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 27
