PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 23       | 27         | 34              | 8        | 13           | 1             | 9              | 
| 26       | 35         | 42              | 8        | 13, 19, 25   | 1             | 1              | 
| 27       | 43         | 45              | 3        | 18, 24, 25   | 2             | 7              | 
| 28       | 46         | 47              | 2        | 15, 26, 27   | 1             | 2              | 
| 30       | 48         | 49              | 2        | 8, 23, 28    | 2             | 4              | 
| 32       | 49         | 49              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is activity 27 not completed before time period 45? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 27 is not completed before time period 45 
1: resource 4 is scarce at time period 38 due to activities 10, 11, 2, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29, 31, 4, 7, 8 
2: resource 4 is scarce at time period 40 due to activities 10, 11, 2, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 4, 7, 8 
3: resource 4 is scarce at time period 42 due to activities 10, 11, 2, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 4, 7, 8 
4: activity 23 must be completed 
5: activity 26 must be completed 
6: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 28 
7: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 30 
8: resource 4 is scarce at time period 34 due to activities 10, 11, 2, 23, 25, 26, 31, 4, 7, 8 
9: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 30 
10: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
11: extends the length of the project beyond time period 49
