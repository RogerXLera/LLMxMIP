PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 13       | 14         | 21              | 8        | 8            | 3             | 6              |

| 32       | 60         | 60              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is the subset of activities 23, 13, 19 not completed at the same time period? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 23, 13, 19 is not completed at the same time period 
1: activity 13 must be completed before starting activity 14 
2: activity 14 must be completed before starting activity 18 
3: activity 18 must be completed before starting activity 20 
4: activity 20 must be completed before starting activity 21 
5: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 22 
6: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 29 
7: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
8: extends the length of the project beyond time period 60
