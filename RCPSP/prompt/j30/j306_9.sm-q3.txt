PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units |

Question: Why is activity 23 not completed before time period 35? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 23 is not completed before time period 35 
1: activity 23 must be completed 
2: activity 17 must be completed before starting activity 23 
3: activity 10 must be completed before starting activity 17 
4: activity 6 must be completed before starting activity 10 
5: resource 3 is scarce at time period 20 due to activities 10, 12, 13, 15, 18, 21, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 
6: resource 3 is scarce at time period 23 due to activities 10, 12, 13, 15, 18, 21, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 
7: activity 6 must be completed 
8: resource 3 is scarce at time period 14 due to activities 13, 15, 18, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 
9: resource 3 is scarce at time period 17 due to activities 13, 15, 18, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 
10: activity 13 must be completed 
11: activity 13 must be completed before starting activity 14 
12: activity 14 must be completed before starting activity 24 
13: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 27 
14: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 29 
15: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
16: extends the length of the project beyond time period 51
