PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution:

Question: Why is activity 25 completed at time period 22 instead of time period 21? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 25 is completed at time period 22 instead of time period 21 
1: resource 2 is scarce at time period 21 due to activities 13, 15, 20, 24, 25, 26, 8 
2: activity 24 must be completed 
3: activity 7 must be completed before starting activity 13 
4: activity 11 must be completed before starting activity 15 
5: activity 13 must be completed before starting activity 15 
6: activity 15 must be completed before starting activity 20 
7: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 27 
8: activity 20 must be completed before starting activity 29 
9: activity 4 must be completed before starting activity 7 
10: activity 3 must be completed before starting activity 11 
11: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 28 
12: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
13: activity 4 must be completed 
14: resource 1 is scarce at time period 2 due to activities 3, 4 
15: resource 1 is scarce at time period 4 due to activities 3, 4, 5 
16: resource 1 is scarce at time period 6 due to activities 3, 4, 5, 9 
17: activity 3 must be completed 
18: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 30 
19: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
20: extends the length of the project beyond time period 43
