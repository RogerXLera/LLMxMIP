PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units |

Question: Why is activity 25 completed at time period 42 instead of time period 41? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 25 is completed at time period 42 instead of time period 41 
1: resource 2 is scarce at time period 37 due to activities 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 4, 5, 7, 9 
2: activity 21 must be completed 
3: activity 24 must be completed 
4: activity 26 must be completed 
5: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 23 
6: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 27 
7: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 29 
8: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 31 
9: resource 4 is scarce at time period 30 due to activities 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21, 26, 3, 8, 9 
10: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 30 
11: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
12: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
13: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
14: extends the length of the project beyond time period 46
