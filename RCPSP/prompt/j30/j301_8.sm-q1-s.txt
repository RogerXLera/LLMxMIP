PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|

Question: Why is activity 25 completed at time period 35? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 25 is completed at time period 35 
1: activity 9 must be completed 
2: activity 14 must be completed 
3: activity 25 must be completed 
4: activity 14 must be completed before starting activity 16 
5: activity 9 must be completed before starting activity 18 
6: activity 16 must be completed before starting activity 18 
7: activity 18 must be completed before starting activity 21 
8: activity 25 must be completed before starting activity 26 
9: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 28 
10: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 29 
11: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 31 
12: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
13: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
14: resource 2 is scarce at time period 11 due to activities 14, 25, 3, 4, 5, 9 
15: resource 2 is scarce at time period 15 due to activities 14, 23, 25, 3, 4, 5, 9 
16: resource 2 is scarce at time period 20 due to activities 14, 23, 25, 27, 3, 4, 5, 9 
17: resource 2 is scarce at time period 25 due to activities 14, 23, 25, 27, 3, 4, 5, 9 
18: resource 2 is scarce at time period 46 due to activities 14, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 3, 31, 4, 5, 9 
19: resource 2 is scarce at time period 48 due to activities 14, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 3, 31, 4, 5, 9 
20: resource 2 is scarce at time period 50 due to activities 14, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 3, 31, 4, 5, 9 
21: resource 2 is scarce at time period 52 due to activities 14, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 3, 31, 4, 5, 9 
22: extends the length of the project beyond time period 53
