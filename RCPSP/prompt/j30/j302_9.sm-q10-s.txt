PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 9        | 18         | 25              | 8        | 5            | 3             | 9              |

| 26       | 38         | 46              | 9        | 16, 21, 23   | 3             | 2              |

Question: Why is activity 11 completed at time period 32 instead of activity 28? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 11 completed at time period 32 instead of activity 28 
1: activity 9 must be completed 
2: activity 11 must be completed 
3: activity 9 must be completed before starting activity 12 
4: activity 12 must be completed before starting activity 16 
5: activity 11 must be completed before starting activity 20 
6: activity 20 must be completed before starting activity 24 
7: activity 16 must be completed before starting activity 26 
8: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 30 
9: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 30 
10: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
11: resource 3 is scarce at time period 21 due to activities 11, 15, 28, 3, 8, 9 
12: resource 3 is scarce at time period 25 due to activities 11, 15, 28, 3, 8, 9 
13: extends the length of the project beyond time period 54 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
