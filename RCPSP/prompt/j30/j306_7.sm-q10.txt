PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|

Question: Why is activity 7 completed at time period 29 instead of activity 18? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 7 completed at time period 29 instead of activity 18 
1: resource 1 is scarce at time period 26 due to activities 10, 11, 13, 17, 18, 21, 3, 5, 6 
2: activity 13 must be completed 
3: activity 21 must be completed 
4: activity 13 must be completed before starting activity 20 
5: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 24 
6: activity 20 must be completed before starting activity 23 
7: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 27 
8: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 31 
9: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 30 
10: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
11: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
12: extends the length of the project beyond time period 46
