PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution:

17: resource 4 is scarce at time period 30 due to activities 10, 12, 15, 17, 18, 2, 27, 28, 3, 8 
18: activity 19 must be completed before starting activity 28 
19: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32

24: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 30 
25: activity 15 must be completed 
26: activity 27 must be completed 
27: activity 13 must be completed before starting activity 17 
28: resource 4 is scarce at time period 16 due to activities 10, 12, 15, 17, 2, 3, 8 
29: activity 7 must be completed
