PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|

Question: Why is the subset of activities 24, 16, 19 not completed at the same time period? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 24, 16, 19 is not completed at the same time period 
1: activity 6 must be completed before starting activity 19 
2: activity 19 must be completed before starting activity 21 
3: resource 2 is scarce at time period 19 due to activities 12, 19, 2, 24, 3, 6, 7 
4: activity 6 must be completed 
5: resource 2 is scarce at time period 13 due to activities 12, 2, 3, 6, 7 
6: activity 12 must be completed before starting activity 21 
7: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 22 
8: activity 7 must be completed 
9: activity 12 must be completed 
10: activity 7 must be completed before starting activity 23 
11: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 30 
12: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 28 
13: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 30 
14: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32
