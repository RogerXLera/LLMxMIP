PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 19       | 27         | 34              | 8        | 2, 10        | 1             | 9              | 
| 21       | 28         | 35              | 8        | 17           | 1             | 5              | 
| 23       | 27         | 34              | 8        | 13           | 1             | 9              | 
| 26       | 35         | 42              | 8        | 13, 19, 25   | 1             | 1              | 
| 27       | 43         | 45              | 3        | 18, 24, 25   | 2             | 7              | 
| 28       | 46         | 47              | 2        | 15, 26, 27   | 1             | 2              | 
| 30       | 48         | 49              | 2        | 8, 23, 28    | 2             | 4              | 
| 32       | 49         | 49              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is the subset of activities 21, 19, 23 not completed at time period 35? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 21, 19, 23 is not completed at time period 35 
1: activity 19 must be completed before starting activity 26 
2: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 28 
3: resource 4 is scarce at time period 38 due to activities 10, 11, 2, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29, 31, 4, 7, 8 
4: resource 4 is scarce at time period 40 due to activities 10, 11, 2, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 4, 7, 8 
5: resource 4 is scarce at time period 43 due to activities 10, 11, 2, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 4, 7, 8 
6: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 28 
7: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 30 
8: activity 27 must be completed 
9: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
10: extends the length of the project beyond time period 49
