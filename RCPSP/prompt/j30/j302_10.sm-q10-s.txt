PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 15       | 13         | 21              | 9        | 11, 13       | 2             | 8              |

Question: Why is activity 19 completed at time period 22 instead of activity 15? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 19 completed at time period 22 instead of activity 15 
1: activity 20 must be completed 
2: activity 24 must be completed 
3: activity 25 must be completed 
4: activity 25 must be completed before starting activity 26 
5: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 27 
6: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 27 
7: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 28 
8: activity 20 must be completed before starting activity 29 
9: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 30 
10: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
11: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
12: resource 2 is scarce at time period 18 due to activities 13, 15, 24, 25, 8 
13: resource 2 is scarce at time period 19 due to activities 13, 15, 24, 25, 26, 8 
14: resource 2 is scarce at time period 20 due to activities 13, 15, 24, 25, 26, 8 
15: resource 2 is scarce at time period 21 due to activities 13, 15, 20, 24, 25, 26, 8 
16: resource 2 is scarce at time period 22 due to activities 13, 15, 20, 24, 25, 26, 8 
17: resource 2 is scarce at time period 28 due to activities 13, 15, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 8 
18: extends the length of the project beyond time period 43
