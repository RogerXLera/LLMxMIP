PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 3        | 5          | 14              | 10       | 1            | 1             | 10             |

Question: Why is activity 17 not completed before time period 26? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 17 is not completed before time period 26 
1: activity 3 must be completed 
2: activity 4 must be completed 
3: activity 17 must be completed 
4: activity 4 must be completed before starting activity 5 
5: activity 5 must be completed before starting activity 8 
6: activity 8 must be completed before starting activity 9 
7: activity 3 must be completed before starting activity 11 
8: activity 11 must be completed before starting activity 14 
9: activity 9 must be completed before starting activity 17 
10: activity 14 must be completed before starting activity 21 
11: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 29 
12: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
13: resource 1 is scarce at time period 4 due to activities 3, 4 
14: resource 1 is scarce at time period 14 due to activities 11, 18, 3, 4, 6, 9 
15: extends the length of the project beyond time period 42 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
