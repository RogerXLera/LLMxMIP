PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution:

Question: Why is activity 25 completed at time period 22? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 25 is completed at time period 22 
1: activity 25 must be completed 
2: activity 25 must be completed before starting activity 26 
3: resource 2 is scarce at time period 18 due to activities 13, 15, 24, 25, 8 
4: resource 2 is scarce at time period 19 due to activities 13, 15, 24, 25, 26, 8 
5: resource 2 is scarce at time period 20 due to activities 13, 15, 24, 25, 26, 8 
6: resource 2 is scarce at time period 21 due to activities 13, 15, 20, 24, 25, 26, 8 
7: resource 2 is scarce at time period 23 due to activities 13, 15, 20, 24, 25, 26, 8 
8: resource 2 is scarce at time period 28 due to activities 13, 15, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 8 
9: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 27 
10: activity 24 must be completed 
11: activity 7 must be completed before starting activity 13 
12: activity 11 must be completed before starting activity 15 
13: activity 13 must be completed before starting activity 15 
14: activity 15 must be completed before starting activity 20 
15: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 27 
16: activity 20 must be completed before starting activity 29 
17: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 28 
18: activity 4 must be completed before starting activity 7 
19: activity 3 must be completed before starting activity 11 
20: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
21: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 30 
22: activity 4 must be completed 
23: resource 1 is scarce at time period 2 due to activities 3, 4 
24: resource 1 is scarce at time period 4 due to activities 3, 4, 5 
25: resource 1 is scarce at time period 6 due to activities 3, 4, 5, 9 
26: activity 3 must be completed 
27: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
28: extends the length of the project beyond time period 43
