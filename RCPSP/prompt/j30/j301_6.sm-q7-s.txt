PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution:

14: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 29 
15: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 30 
16: activity 18 must be completed before starting activity 31 
17: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 31 
18: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
19: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
20: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
21: resource 2 is scarce at time period 15 due to activities 13, 21, 7 
22: resource 2 is scarce at time period 17 due to activities 13, 21, 7 
23: resource 3 is scarce at time period 48 due to activities 11, 14, 16, 29, 30, 31 
24: resource 4 is scarce at time period 16 due to activities 10, 12, 15, 17, 2, 3, 8 
25: resource 4 is scarce at time period 19 due to activities 10, 12, 15, 17, 18, 2, 27, 3, 8 
26: resource 4 is scarce at time period 22 due to activities 10, 12, 15, 17, 18, 2, 27, 3, 8 
27: resource 4 is scarce at time period 25 due to activities 10, 12, 15, 17, 18, 2, 27, 28, 3, 8 
28: resource 4 is scarce at time period 28 due to activities 10, 12, 15, 17, 18, 2, 27, 28, 3, 8 
29: resource 4 is scarce at time period 30 due to activities 10, 12, 15, 17, 18, 2, 27, 28, 3, 8 
30: resource 4 is scarce at time period 33 due to activities 10, 12, 15, 17, 18, 2, 26, 27, 28, 3, 8 
31: resource 4 is scarce at time period 42 due to activities 10, 12, 15, 17, 18, 2, 26, 27, 28, 3, 8 
32: extends the length of the project beyond time period 48
