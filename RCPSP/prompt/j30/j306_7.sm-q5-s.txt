PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 21       | 23         | 31              | 9        | 16           | 1             | 10             | 
| 22       | 32         | 35              | 4        | 20           | 4             | 10             | 
| 24       | 32         | 37              | 6        | 15, 21       | 1             | 5              | 
| 26       | 36         | 42              | 7        | 13, 15       | 2             | 3              | 
| 27       | 38         | 38              | 1        | 7, 17, 24    | 1             | 4              | 
| 29       | 43         | 46              | 4        | 11, 26, 28   | 1             | 6              | 
| 30       | 39         | 43              | 5        | 18, 22, 27   | 2             | 2              | 
| 32       | 46         | 46              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is the subset of activities 29, 32 completed at time period 46? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 29, 32 is completed at time period 46 
1: activity 21 must be completed 
2: activity 22 must be completed 
3: activity 26 must be completed 
4: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 24 
5: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 27 
6: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 29 
7: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 30 
8: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 30 
9: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
10: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
11: resource 4 is scarce at time period 31 due to activities 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21, 26, 3, 8, 9 
12: resource 4 is scarce at time period 35 due to activities 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 26, 29, 3, 8, 9 
13: resource 4 is scarce at time period 38 due to activities 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 26, 29, 3, 8, 9 
14: extends the length of the project beyond time period 46 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
