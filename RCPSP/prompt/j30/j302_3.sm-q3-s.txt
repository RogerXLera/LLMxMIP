PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units |

Question: Why is activity 26 not completed before time period 35? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 26 is not completed before time period 35 
1: activity 6 must be completed 
2: activity 7 must be completed 
3: activity 12 must be completed 
4: activity 24 must be completed 
5: activity 26 must be completed 
6: activity 6 must be completed before starting activity 19 
7: activity 12 must be completed before starting activity 21 
8: activity 19 must be completed before starting activity 21 
9: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 22 
10: activity 7 must be completed before starting activity 23 
11: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 26 
12: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 28 
13: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 30 
14: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 30 
15: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
16: resource 2 is scarce at time period 13 due to activities 12, 2, 3, 6, 7 
17: resource 2 is scarce at time period 19 due to activities 12, 19, 2, 24, 3, 6, 7 
18: extends the length of the project beyond time period 43 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
