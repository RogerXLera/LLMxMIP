PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units |

Question: Why is activity 14 completed at time period 17 instead of activity 15? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 14 completed at time period 17 instead of activity 15 
1: activity 14 must be completed 
2: activity 15 must be completed 
3: activity 7 must be completed before starting activity 15 
4: activity 14 must be completed before starting activity 19 
5: resource 3 is scarce at time period 12 due to activities 11, 14, 2, 7 
6: resource 3 is scarce at time period 9 due to activities 14, 2, 7 
7: resource 3 is scarce at time period 18 due to activities 11, 14, 2, 7 
8: activity 7 must be completed 
9: activity 19 must be completed before starting activity 21 
10: activity 11 must be completed 
11: activity 11 must be completed before starting activity 27 
12: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 22 
13: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 29 
14: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 30 
15: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
16: resource 2 is scarce at time period 37 due to activities 10, 16, 20, 25, 29, 3, 30 
17: resource 2 is scarce at time period 38 due to activities 10, 16, 20, 25, 29, 3, 30 
18: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
19: extends the length of the project beyond time period 38
