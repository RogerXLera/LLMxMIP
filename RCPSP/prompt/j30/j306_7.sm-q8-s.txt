PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|

Question: Why is the subset of activities 7, 12, 13, 28 not completed at the same time period? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 7, 12, 13, 28 is not completed at the same time period 
1: activity 13 must be completed 
2: activity 21 must be completed 
3: activity 26 must be completed 
4: activity 13 must be completed before starting activity 20 
5: activity 20 must be completed before starting activity 22 
6: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 24 
7: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 27 
8: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 29 
9: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 30 
10: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 30 
11: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
12: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
13: resource 2 is scarce at time period 26 due to activities 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 28, 4, 5, 7, 9 
14: resource 4 is scarce at time period 31 due to activities 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21, 26, 3, 8, 9 
15: resource 4 is scarce at time period 36 due to activities 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 26, 29, 3, 8, 9 
16: resource 4 is scarce at time period 38 due to activities 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 26, 29, 3, 8, 9 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
