PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 14       | 25         | 32              | 8        | 12, 13       | 2             | 9              |

| 19       | 38         | 42              | 5        | 14, 17       | 1             | 3              | 
| 25       | 33         | 40              | 8        | 4, 20        | 2             | 6              | 
| 27       | 47         | 56              | 10       | 19, 23, 25   | 1             | 9              | 
| 31       | 57         | 60              | 4        | 24, 26, 27   | 2             | 2              | 
| 32       | 60         | 60              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is activity 25 completed at time period 40 instead of time period 39? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 25 is completed at time period 40 instead of time period 39 
1: resource 2 is scarce at time period 32 due to activities 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 2, 20, 21, 23, 25, 26, 4, 5 
2: resource 2 is scarce at time period 34 due to activities 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 2, 20, 21, 23, 25, 26, 4, 5 
3: activity 14 must be completed 
4: activity 17 must be completed 
5: activity 14 must be completed before starting activity 19 
6: activity 17 must be completed before starting activity 19 
7: activity 19 must be completed before starting activity 27 
8: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 31 
9: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
10: extends the length of the project beyond time period 60
