PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 2        | 3          | 3               | 1        | 1            | 3             | 3              | 
| 4        | 1          | 2               | 2        | 1            | 3             | 10             | 
| 7        | 4          | 5               | 2        | 2            | 2             | 1              | 
| 8        | 6          | 15              | 10       | 7            | 3             | 6              | 
| 9        | 3          | 10              | 8        | 4            | 3             | 1              |

| 16       | 16         | 21              | 6        | 8            | 3             | 10             |

| 19       | 22         | 31              | 10       | 16, 18       | 2             | 3              | 
| 22       | 32         | 40              | 9        | 19           | 1             | 2              | 
Question: Why is activity 22 not completed before time period 40? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 22 is not completed before time period 40 
1: activity 2 must be completed 
2: activity 4 must be completed 
3: activity 22 must be completed 
4: activity 2 must be completed before starting activity 7 
5: activity 7 must be completed before starting activity 8 
6: activity 4 must be completed before starting activity 9 
7: activity 9 must be completed before starting activity 13 
8: activity 8 must be completed before starting activity 16 
9: activity 13 must be completed before starting activity 18 
10: activity 16 must be completed before starting activity 19 
11: activity 18 must be completed before starting activity 19 
12: activity 19 must be completed before starting activity 22 
13: resource 3 is scarce at time period 1 due to activities 2, 4 
14: resource 3 is scarce at time period 2 due to activities 2, 4 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
