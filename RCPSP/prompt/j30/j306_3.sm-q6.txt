PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution:

Question: Why is the subset of activities 19, 14, 24 not completed at time period 24? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 19, 14, 24 is not completed at time period 24 
1: activity 14 must be completed 
2: activity 19 must be completed 
3: activity 10 must be completed before starting activity 14 
4: activity 13 must be completed before starting activity 19 
5: resource 4 is scarce at time period 23 due to activities 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19, 2, 21, 26, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 
6: activity 5 must be completed before starting activity 10 
7: activity 13 must be completed 
8: resource 3 is scarce at time period 13 due to activities 11, 13, 18, 2, 21, 4, 5 
9: activity 5 must be completed 
10: activity 11 must be completed 
11: activity 17 must be completed 
12: activity 11 must be completed before starting activity 16 
13: activity 17 must be completed before starting activity 22 
14: activity 16 must be completed before starting activity 20 
15: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 28 
16: activity 20 must be completed before starting activity 25 
17: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 29 
18: activity 25 must be completed before starting activity 29 
19: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
20: extends the length of the project beyond time period 48
