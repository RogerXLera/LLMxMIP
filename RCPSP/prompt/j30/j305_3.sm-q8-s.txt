PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 8        | 26         | 33              | 8        | 6            | 1             | 3              | 
| 9        | 31         | 33              | 3        | 7            | 1             | 2              | 
| 13       | 25         | 33              | 9        | 10           | 1             | 1              | 
| 17       | 43         | 46              | 4        | 13           | 1             | 10             | 
| 20       | 37         | 42              | 6        | 11, 13       | 1             | 9              | 
| 21       | 48         | 51              | 4        | 14, 17       | 2             | 1              | 
| 22       | 34         | 36              | 3        | 8, 18        | 1             | 6              | 
| 25       | 52         | 53              | 2        | 18, 21       | 3             | 8              | 
Question: Why is the subset of activities 22, 8, 9, 13 not completed at the same time period? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 22, 8, 9, 13 is not completed at the same time period 
1: activity 13 must be completed 
2: activity 20 must be completed 
3: activity 22 must be completed 
4: activity 25 must be completed 
5: activity 13 must be completed before starting activity 17 
6: activity 13 must be completed before starting activity 20 
7: activity 17 must be completed before starting activity 21 
8: activity 8 must be completed before starting activity 22 
9: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 25 
10: resource 1 is scarce at time period 151 due to activities 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24, 27, 31, 7, 8, 9 
11: resource 3 is scarce at time period 157 due to activities 15, 16, 20, 22, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 9 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
