PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 6        | 11         | 17              | 7        | 5            | 3             | 10             |

Question: Why is activity 23 not completed before time period 35? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 23 is not completed before time period 35 
1: activity 6 must be completed 
2: activity 13 must be completed 
3: activity 23 must be completed 
4: activity 6 must be completed before starting activity 10 
5: activity 13 must be completed before starting activity 14 
6: activity 10 must be completed before starting activity 17 
7: activity 17 must be completed before starting activity 23 
8: activity 14 must be completed before starting activity 24 
9: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 27 
10: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 29 
11: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
12: resource 3 is scarce at time period 14 due to activities 13, 15, 18, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 
13: resource 3 is scarce at time period 17 due to activities 13, 15, 18, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 
14: resource 3 is scarce at time period 20 due to activities 10, 12, 13, 15, 18, 21, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 
15: resource 3 is scarce at time period 23 due to activities 10, 12, 13, 15, 18, 21, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 
16: extends the length of the project beyond time period 51 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
