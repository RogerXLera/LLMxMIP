PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units |

Question: Why is the subset of activities 19, 14, 24 not completed at time period 24? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 19, 14, 24 is not completed at time period 24 
1: activity 5 must be completed 
2: activity 11 must be completed 
3: activity 13 must be completed 
4: activity 14 must be completed 
5: activity 17 must be completed 
6: activity 19 must be completed 
7: activity 5 must be completed before starting activity 10 
8: activity 10 must be completed before starting activity 14 
9: activity 11 must be completed before starting activity 16 
10: activity 13 must be completed before starting activity 19 
11: activity 16 must be completed before starting activity 20 
12: activity 17 must be completed before starting activity 22 
13: activity 20 must be completed before starting activity 25 
14: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 28 
15: activity 25 must be completed before starting activity 29 
16: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 29 
17: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
18: resource 3 is scarce at time period 13 due to activities 11, 13, 18, 2, 21, 4, 5 
19: resource 4 is scarce at time period 23 due to activities 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19, 2, 21, 26, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 
20: extends the length of the project beyond time period 48 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
