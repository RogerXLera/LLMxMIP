PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 13       | 24         | 25              | 2        | 8            | 1             | 5              | 
| 20       | 26         | 35              | 10       | 13           | 1             | 4              | 
| 26       | 36         | 45              | 10       | 11, 20       | 3             | 8              | 
| 28       | 46         | 53              | 8        | 6, 26, 27    | 3             | 1              | 
| 29       | 54         | 59              | 6        | 7, 24, 28    | 1             | 5              | 
| 32       | 59         | 59              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is activity 13 completed at time period 25 instead of activity 8? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 13 completed at time period 25 instead of activity 8 
1: activity 13 must be completed 
2: activity 13 must be completed before starting activity 20 
3: activity 20 must be completed before starting activity 26 
4: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 28 
5: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 29 
6: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
7: extends the length of the project beyond time period 59
