PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units |

18: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 31 
19: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
20: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
21: resource 1 is scarce at time period 40 due to activities 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 2, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 5, 7, 8, 9 
22: resource 4 is scarce at time period 16 due to activities 11, 12, 13, 15, 3, 4, 7, 8 
23: resource 4 is scarce at time period 20 due to activities 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 3, 4, 7, 8 
24: resource 4 is scarce at time period 27 due to activities 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21, 24, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 
25: resource 4 is scarce at time period 30 due to activities 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, 23, 24, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 
26: resource 4 is scarce at time period 34 due to activities 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 
27: extends the length of the project beyond time period 56
