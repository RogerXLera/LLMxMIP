PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 25       | 32         | 34              | 3        | 12           | 1             | 5              | 
| 27       | 35         | 44              | 10       | 14, 22, 25   | 3             | 5              | 
| 31       | 45         | 45              | 1        | 19, 23, 27   | 1             | 5              | 
| 32       | 45         | 45              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is activity 25 not completed after time period 34? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 25 is not completed after time period 34 
1: activity 25 must be completed before starting activity 27 
2: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 31 
3: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
4: extends the length of the project beyond time period 45 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
