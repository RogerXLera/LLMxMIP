PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 14       | 26         | 29              | 4        | 6            | 1             | 9              | 
| 18       | 33         | 38              | 6        | 13, 14       | 1             | 4              | 
| 22       | 16         | 25              | 10       | 9            | 1             | 3              | 
| 24       | 35         | 41              | 7        | 12, 22, 23   | 2             | 7              | 
| 26       | 26         | 34              | 9        | 15, 22       | 1             | 1              | 
| 29       | 44         | 50              | 7        | 18, 22, 28   | 2             | 4              | 
| 30       | 45         | 50              | 6        | 24, 25, 26   | 2             | 8              | 
| 32       | 50         | 50              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is the subset of activities 14, 22 not completed at time period 29? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 14, 22 is not completed at time period 29 
1: activity 18 must be completed 
2: activity 24 must be completed 
3: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 26 
4: activity 18 must be completed before starting activity 29 
5: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 30 
6: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 30 
7: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
8: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
9: resource 3 is scarce at time period 38 due to activities 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 6, 7, 8, 9 
10: extends the length of the project beyond time period 50 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
