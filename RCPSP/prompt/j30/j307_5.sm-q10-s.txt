PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|

Question: Why is activity 23 completed at time period 23 instead of activity 6? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 23 completed at time period 23 instead of activity 6 
1: activity 18 must be completed 
2: activity 20 must be completed 
3: activity 24 must be completed 
4: activity 20 must be completed before starting activity 22 
5: activity 6 must be completed before starting activity 23 
6: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 25 
7: activity 18 must be completed before starting activity 26 
8: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 26 
9: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 28 
10: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 29 
11: activity 25 must be completed before starting activity 30 
12: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 31 
13: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
14: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
15: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
16: resource 1 is scarce at time period 41 due to activities 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 24, 27, 29, 30, 31, 4, 6, 7, 8 
17: resource 2 is scarce at time period 26 due to activities 10, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 25, 26, 3, 5, 7, 8 
18: resource 4 is scarce at time period 16 due to activities 11, 18, 24, 3, 6, 8 
19: resource 4 is scarce at time period 23 due to activities 11, 18, 19, 20, 24, 3, 6, 8 
20: extends the length of the project beyond time period 44 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
