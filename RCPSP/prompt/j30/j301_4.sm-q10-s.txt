PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 8        | 18         | 24              | 7        | 5            | 3             | 4              | 
| 10       | 25         | 28              | 4        | 8            | 4             | 4              | 
| 12       | 35         | 43              | 9        | 10           | 3             | 3              | 
| 20       | 44         | 52              | 9        | 7, 12        | 2             | 7              | 
| 24       | 25         | 34              | 10       | 7            | 3             | 10             | 
| 29       | 53         | 62              | 10       | 3, 12, 17    | 2             | 6              | 
| 30       | 54         | 62              | 9        | 20, 26, 28   | 4             | 6              | 
| 32       | 62         | 62              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is activity 22 completed at time period 31 instead of activity 24? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 22 completed at time period 31 instead of activity 24 
1: activity 8 must be completed 
2: activity 8 must be completed before starting activity 10 
3: activity 10 must be completed before starting activity 12 
4: activity 12 must be completed before starting activity 20 
5: activity 12 must be completed before starting activity 29 
6: activity 20 must be completed before starting activity 30 
7: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
8: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
9: resource 2 is scarce at time period 53 due to activities 13, 15, 17, 20, 22, 29, 3, 4 
10: resource 3 is scarce at time period 24 due to activities 24, 27, 5, 8 
11: extends the length of the project beyond time period 62 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
