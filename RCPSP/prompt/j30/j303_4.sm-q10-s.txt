PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 11       | 37         | 45              | 9        | 7, 10        | 3             | 8              | 
| 12       | 46         | 52              | 7        | 11           | 1             | 2              | 
| 16       | 53         | 61              | 9        | 12           | 1             | 10             | 
| 22       | 62         | 71              | 10       | 8, 14, 16    | 3             | 3              | 
| 26       | 72         | 78              | 7        | 22, 23, 24   | 4             | 10             | 
| 27       | 79         | 81              | 3        | 20, 26       | 4             | 6              | 
| 28       | 82         | 89              | 8        | 27           | 3             | 7              |

| 32       | 98         | 98              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is activity 11 completed at time period 45 instead of activity 25? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 11 completed at time period 45 instead of activity 25 
1: activity 11 must be completed 
2: activity 11 must be completed before starting activity 12 
3: activity 12 must be completed before starting activity 16 
4: activity 16 must be completed before starting activity 22 
5: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 26 
6: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 27 
7: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 28 
8: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 31 
9: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
10: extends the length of the project beyond time period 98 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
