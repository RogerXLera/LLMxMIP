PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 14       | 22         | 27              | 6        | 9            | 3             | 1              | 
| 18       | 28         | 37              | 10       | 8, 14, 17    | 4             | 9              | 
| 24       | 38         | 47              | 10       | 18           | 3             | 3              | 
| 26       | 48         | 55              | 8        | 10, 24       | 2             | 3              | 
| 27       | 56         | 63              | 8        | 12, 25, 26   | 2             | 8              | 
| 31       | 64         | 72              | 9        | 16, 27       | 3             | 2              | 
| 32       | 72         | 72              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is activity 14 completed at time period 27 instead of activity 10? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 14 completed at time period 27 instead of activity 10 
1: activity 14 must be completed 
2: activity 14 must be completed before starting activity 18 
3: activity 18 must be completed before starting activity 24 
4: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 26 
5: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 27 
6: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 31 
7: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
8: extends the length of the project beyond time period 72 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
