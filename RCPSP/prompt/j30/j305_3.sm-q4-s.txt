PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 25       | 52         | 53              | 2        | 18, 21       | 3             | 8              | 
| 28       | 59         | 67              | 9        | 4, 25        | 2             | 1              | 
| 30       | 54         | 58              | 5        | 11, 16, 25   | 2             | 5              | 
| 31       | 68         | 76              | 9        | 24, 27, 28   | 1             | 4              | 
| 32       | 76         | 76              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is activity 25 not completed after time period 53? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 25 is not completed after time period 53 
1: activity 25 must be completed before starting activity 28 
2: activity 25 must be completed before starting activity 30 
3: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 31 
4: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
5: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
6: resource 3 is scarce at time period 59 due to activities 10, 13, 15, 16, 2, 20, 22, 25, 27, 28, 29, 3, 30, 31, 6, 7, 9 
7: resource 3 is scarce at time period 63 due to activities 10, 13, 15, 16, 2, 20, 22, 25, 27, 28, 29, 3, 30, 31, 6, 7, 9 
8: resource 3 is scarce at time period 68 due to activities 10, 13, 15, 16, 2, 20, 22, 25, 27, 28, 29, 3, 30, 31, 6, 7, 9 
9: resource 3 is scarce at time period 72 due to activities 10, 13, 15, 16, 2, 20, 22, 25, 27, 28, 29, 3, 30, 31, 6, 7, 9 
10: extends the length of the project beyond time period 76
