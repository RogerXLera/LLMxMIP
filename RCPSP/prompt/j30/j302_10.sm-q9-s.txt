PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units |

Question: Why is activity 25 completed at time period 22 instead of time period 21? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 25 is completed at time period 22 instead of time period 21 
1: activity 3 must be completed 
2: activity 4 must be completed 
3: activity 24 must be completed 
4: activity 4 must be completed before starting activity 7 
5: activity 3 must be completed before starting activity 11 
6: activity 7 must be completed before starting activity 13 
7: activity 11 must be completed before starting activity 15 
8: activity 13 must be completed before starting activity 15 
9: activity 15 must be completed before starting activity 20 
10: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 27 
11: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 28 
12: activity 20 must be completed before starting activity 29 
13: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 30 
14: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
15: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
16: resource 1 is scarce at time period 2 due to activities 3, 4 
17: resource 1 is scarce at time period 4 due to activities 3, 4, 5 
18: resource 1 is scarce at time period 6 due to activities 3, 4, 5, 9 
19: resource 2 is scarce at time period 21 due to activities 13, 15, 20, 24, 25, 26, 8 
20: extends the length of the project beyond time period 43 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
