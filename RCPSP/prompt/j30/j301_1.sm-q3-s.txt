PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 16       | 14         | 23              | 10       | 10           | 4             | 5              | 
| 17       | 24         | 29              | 6        | 13, 14       | 4             | 8              | 
| 22       | 30         | 36              | 7        | 16, 17, 18   | 1             | 2              | 
| 23       | 37         | 38              | 2        | 20, 22       | 1             | 3              | 
| 24       | 39         | 41              | 3        | 19, 23       | 2             | 9              | 
Question: Why is activity 24 not completed before time period 41? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 24 is not completed before time period 41 
1: activity 16 must be completed 
2: activity 17 must be completed 
3: activity 24 must be completed 
4: activity 16 must be completed before starting activity 22 
5: activity 17 must be completed before starting activity 22 
6: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 23 
7: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 24 
8: resource 4 is scarce at time period 23 due to activities 10, 16, 17, 18, 27, 4, 6 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
