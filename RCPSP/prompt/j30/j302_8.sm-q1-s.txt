PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 12       | 33         | 39              | 7        | 9            | 4             | 8              | 
| 18       | 40         | 41              | 2        | 12           | 3             | 9              | 
| 23       | 27         | 32              | 6        | 22           | 4             | 3              | 
| 25       | 42         | 46              | 5        | 4, 18, 24    | 3             | 6              | 
| 27       | 33         | 42              | 10       | 21, 23       | 1             | 10             | 
| 28       | 47         | 51              | 5        | 17, 19, 25   | 1             | 4              | 
| 30       | 52         | 54              | 3        | 11, 26, 28   | 2             | 7              | 
| 31       | 43         | 46              | 4        | 5, 27        | 1             | 10             | 
| 32       | 54         | 54              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is activity 25 completed at time period 46? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 25 is completed at time period 46 
1: activity 12 must be completed 
2: activity 23 must be completed 
3: activity 12 must be completed before starting activity 18 
4: activity 18 must be completed before starting activity 25 
5: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 27 
6: activity 25 must be completed before starting activity 28 
7: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 30 
8: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 31 
9: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
10: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
11: resource 1 is scarce at time period 47 due to activities 10, 13, 27, 28, 29, 3, 31 
12: resource 4 is scarce at time period 32 due to activities 11, 12, 14, 20, 23, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 
13: extends the length of the project beyond time period 54 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
