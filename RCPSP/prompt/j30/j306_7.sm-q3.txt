PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units |

Question: Why is activity 31 not completed before time period 45? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 31 is not completed before time period 45 
1: activity 31 must be completed 
2: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 31 
3: activity 25 must be completed before starting activity 31 
4: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 23 
5: resource 2 is scarce at time period 36 due to activities 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 4, 5, 7, 9 
6: resource 2 is scarce at time period 37 due to activities 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 4, 5, 7, 9 
7: activity 25 must be completed 
8: activity 21 must be completed 
9: resource 4 is scarce at time period 30 due to activities 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21, 26, 3, 8, 9 
10: activity 24 must be completed 
11: activity 26 must be completed 
12: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 27 
13: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 29 
14: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 30 
15: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
16: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
17: extends the length of the project beyond time period 46
