PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units |

Question: Why is activity 25 completed at time period 46 instead of time period 45? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 25 is completed at time period 46 instead of time period 45 
1: activity 25 must be completed 
2: activity 18 must be completed before starting activity 25 
3: activity 12 must be completed before starting activity 18 
4: activity 12 must be completed 
5: resource 4 is scarce at time period 32 due to activities 11, 12, 14, 20, 23, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 
6: activity 23 must be completed 
7: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 27 
8: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 31 
9: resource 1 is scarce at time period 47 due to activities 10, 13, 27, 28, 29, 3, 31 
10: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
11: activity 28 must be completed 
12: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 30 
13: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
14: extends the length of the project beyond time period 54
