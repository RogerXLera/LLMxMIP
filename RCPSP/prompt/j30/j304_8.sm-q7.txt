PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 19       | 27         | 34              | 8        | 14, 16       | 4             | 4              | 
| 26       | 26         | 34              | 9        | 8, 17        | 1             | 10             | 
| 27       | 35         | 39              | 5        | 19, 26       | 1             | 4              | 
| 28       | 40         | 46              | 7        | 25, 27       | 3             | 7              | 
| 29       | 47         | 55              | 9        | 23, 24, 28   | 1             | 9              | 
| 32       | 55         | 55              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is the subset of activities 19, 26 completed at the same time period? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 19, 26 is completed at the same time period 
1: activity 19 must be completed 
2: activity 26 must be completed 
3: activity 19 must be completed before starting activity 27 
4: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 27 
5: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 28 
6: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 29 
7: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
8: extends the length of the project beyond time period 55
