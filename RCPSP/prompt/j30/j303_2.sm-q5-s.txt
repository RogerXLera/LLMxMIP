PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 20       | 21         | 28              | 8        | 19           | 3             | 10             | 
| 24       | 30         | 35              | 6        | 17, 20       | 4             | 4              | 
| 25       | 29         | 37              | 9        | 16           | 3             | 9              | 
| 31       | 38         | 40              | 3        | 24, 25, 28   | 3             | 9              | 
| 32       | 40         | 40              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is the subset of activities 31, 32 completed at time period 40? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 31, 32 is completed at time period 40 
1: activity 20 must be completed 
2: activity 25 must be completed 
3: activity 20 must be completed before starting activity 24 
4: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 31 
5: activity 25 must be completed before starting activity 31 
6: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
7: resource 3 is scarce at time period 28 due to activities 17, 2, 20, 22, 23, 25, 4 
8: extends the length of the project beyond time period 40 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
