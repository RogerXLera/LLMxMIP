PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units |

Question: Why is the subset of activities 12, 18, 9, 31 not completed at time period 19? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 12, 18, 9, 31 is not completed at time period 19 
1: activity 9 must be completed before starting activity 14 
2: activity 14 must be completed before starting activity 22 
3: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 23 
4: resource 2 is scarce at time period 26 due to activities 16, 22, 24, 3 
5: resource 2 is scarce at time period 28 due to activities 16, 22, 24, 3 
6: resource 2 is scarce at time period 30 due to activities 16, 22, 24, 3 
7: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 30 
8: activity 16 must be completed 
9: activity 16 must be completed before starting activity 25 
10: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
11: resource 3 is scarce at time period 47 due to activities 19, 20, 21, 27, 30, 31, 8 
12: resource 3 is scarce at time period 53 due to activities 19, 20, 21, 27, 29, 30, 31, 8 
13: activity 25 must be completed before starting activity 26 
14: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
15: extends the length of the project beyond time period 59 
16: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 27 
17: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 29
