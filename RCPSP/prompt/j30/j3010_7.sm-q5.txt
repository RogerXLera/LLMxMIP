PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|

Question: Why is the subset of activities 29, 32 completed at time period 49? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 29, 32 is completed at time period 49 
1: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 29 
2: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
3: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
4: extends the length of the project beyond time period 49 
5: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 28 
6: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 28 
7: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 30 
8: activity 25 must be completed before starting activity 30 
9: activity 24 must be completed 
10: resource 3 is scarce at time period 23 due to activities 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 2, 20, 22, 24, 26, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 
11: resource 3 is scarce at time period 29 due to activities 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 2, 20, 22, 24, 26, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 
12: activity 26 must be completed 
13: activity 16 must be completed before starting activity 21 
14: activity 19 must be completed before starting activity 25 
15: activity 11 must be completed 
16: activity 15 must be completed 
17: activity 11 must be completed before starting activity 16 
18: activity 15 must be completed before starting activity 19
