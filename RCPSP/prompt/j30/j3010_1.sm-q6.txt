PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 13       | 20         | 20              | 1        | 8            | 1             | 10             | 
| 18       | 16         | 20              | 5        | 6, 7, 17     | 2             | 10             | 
| 21       | 22         | 31              | 10       | 15, 18       | 2             | 8              | 
| 26       | 36         | 40              | 5        | 21, 23, 25   | 1             | 1              | 
| 28       | 17         | 26              | 10       | 2            | 1             | 7              | 
| 29       | 41         | 42              | 2        | 19, 26       | 1             | 1              | 
| 32       | 42         | 42              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is the subset of activities 28, 13, 18 not completed at time period 26? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 28, 13, 18 is not completed at time period 26 
1: activity 18 must be completed before starting activity 21 
2: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 26 
3: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 29 
4: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
5: extends the length of the project beyond time period 42
