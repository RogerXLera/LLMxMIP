PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units |

Question: Why is activity 10 completed at time period 26 instead of activity 18? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 10 completed at time period 26 instead of activity 18 
1: activity 9 must be completed 
2: activity 12 must be completed 
3: activity 14 must be completed 
4: activity 15 must be completed 
5: activity 12 must be completed before starting activity 16 
6: activity 9 must be completed before starting activity 17 
7: activity 17 must be completed before starting activity 19 
8: activity 14 must be completed before starting activity 21 
9: activity 15 must be completed before starting activity 21 
10: activity 19 must be completed before starting activity 23 
11: activity 14 must be completed before starting activity 24 
12: activity 16 must be completed before starting activity 25 
13: activity 25 must be completed before starting activity 26 
14: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 27 
15: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 27 
16: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 27 
17: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 30 
18: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 30 
19: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
20: resource 1 is scarce at time period 21 due to activities 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 20, 24, 3, 8, 9 
21: resource 1 is scarce at time period 26 due to activities 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 3, 8, 9 
22: resource 3 is scarce at time period 16 due to activities 11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 2, 6 
23: resource 3 is scarce at time period 20 due to activities 11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 2, 22, 6 
24: resource 3 is scarce at time period 26 due to activities 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 2, 22, 25, 6 
25: resource 3 is scarce at time period 30 due to activities 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 2, 22, 25, 6 
26: resource 4 is scarce at time period 38 due to activities 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 2, 21, 24, 25, 28, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 
27: extends the length of the project beyond time period 61 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
