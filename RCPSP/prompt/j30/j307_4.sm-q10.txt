PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution:

Question: Why is activity 21 completed at time period 26 instead of activity 14? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 21 completed at time period 26 instead of activity 14 
1: activity 12 must be completed before starting activity 21 
2: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 26 
3: activity 12 must be completed 
4: resource 2 is scarce at time period 12 due to activities 12, 2, 4, 7, 9 
5: resource 2 is scarce at time period 14 due to activities 12, 2, 4, 7, 9 
6: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 28 
7: resource 1 is scarce at time period 27 due to activities 10, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 2, 20, 23, 26, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 
8: activity 7 must be completed 
9: activity 9 must be completed 
10: activity 9 must be completed before starting activity 10 
11: activity 7 must be completed before starting activity 13 
12: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 28 
13: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 29 
14: activity 10 must be completed before starting activity 22 
15: activity 13 must be completed before starting activity 23 
16: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 27 
17: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
18: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 24 
19: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
20: extends the length of the project beyond time period 44 
21: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 31
