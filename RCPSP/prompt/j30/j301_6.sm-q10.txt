PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units |

Question: Why is activity 19 completed at time period 24 instead of activity 9? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 19 completed at time period 24 instead of activity 9 
1: activity 9 must be completed 
2: activity 7 must be completed before starting activity 9 
3: activity 7 must be completed 
4: resource 2 is scarce at time period 14 due to activities 13, 21, 7 
5: resource 2 is scarce at time period 17 due to activities 13, 21, 7 
6: activity 13 must be completed 
7: activity 13 must be completed before starting activity 17 
8: activity 17 must be completed before starting activity 18 
9: resource 4 is scarce at time period 23 due to activities 10, 12, 15, 17, 18, 2, 27, 28, 3, 8 
10: resource 4 is scarce at time period 26 due to activities 10, 12, 15, 17, 18, 2, 27, 28, 3, 8 
11: resource 4 is scarce at time period 29 due to activities 10, 12, 15, 17, 18, 2, 27, 28, 3, 8 
12: resource 4 is scarce at time period 33 due to activities 10, 12, 15, 17, 18, 2, 26, 27, 28, 3, 8 
13: resource 4 is scarce at time period 42 due to activities 10, 12, 15, 17, 18, 2, 26, 27, 28, 3, 8 
14: activity 18 must be completed before starting activity 20 
15: activity 27 must be completed 
16: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 30 
17: activity 20 must be completed before starting activity 26 
18: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 29 
19: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
20: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
21: extends the length of the project beyond time period 48
