PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution:

Question: Why is activity 25 completed at time period 50 instead of time period 49? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 25 is completed at time period 50 instead of time period 49 
1: activity 25 must be completed 
2: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 25 
3: resource 3 is scarce at time period 42 due to activities 10, 15, 17, 18, 19, 22, 24, 25, 3, 30, 4, 5, 7 
4: resource 3 is scarce at time period 46 due to activities 10, 15, 17, 18, 19, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 3, 30, 4, 5, 7 
5: activity 18 must be completed before starting activity 21 
6: activity 3 must be completed 
7: activity 4 must be completed 
8: activity 3 must be completed before starting activity 5 
9: activity 5 must be completed before starting activity 7 
10: activity 7 must be completed before starting activity 10 
11: activity 4 must be completed before starting activity 12 
12: activity 12 must be completed before starting activity 18 
13: activity 10 must be completed before starting activity 19 
14: activity 19 must be completed before starting activity 23 
15: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 26 
16: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 29 
17: resource 3 is scarce at time period 30 due to activities 10, 15, 17, 18, 24, 3, 4, 5, 7 
18: resource 3 is scarce at time period 4 due to activities 3, 4 
19: resource 3 is scarce at time period 8 due to activities 15, 3, 4 
20: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
21: extends the length of the project beyond time period 67
