PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units |

Question: Why is activity 25 completed at time period 35 instead of time period 34? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 25 is completed at time period 35 instead of time period 34 
1: activity 25 must be completed 
2: activity 19 must be completed before starting activity 25 
3: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 25 
4: resource 2 is scarce at time period 26 due to activities 10, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 25, 26, 3, 5, 7, 8 
5: activity 19 must be completed 
6: resource 4 is scarce at time period 24 due to activities 11, 18, 19, 20, 24, 26, 3, 6, 8 
7: activity 24 must be completed 
8: resource 4 is scarce at time period 16 due to activities 11, 18, 24, 3, 6, 8 
9: resource 4 is scarce at time period 17 due to activities 11, 18, 24, 3, 6, 8 
10: activity 18 must be completed 
11: activity 20 must be completed 
12: activity 20 must be completed before starting activity 22 
13: activity 6 must be completed before starting activity 23 
14: activity 18 must be completed before starting activity 26 
15: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 26 
16: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 29 
17: activity 6 must be completed 
18: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 28 
19: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
20: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 31 
21: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
22: extends the length of the project beyond time period 44
