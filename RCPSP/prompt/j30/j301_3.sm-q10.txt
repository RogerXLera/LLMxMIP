PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|

Question: Why is activity 17 completed at time period 23 instead of activity 11? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 17 completed at time period 23 instead of activity 11 
1: activity 17 must be completed 
2: activity 17 must be completed before starting activity 24 
3: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 27 
4: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 28 
5: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 31 
6: resource 4 is scarce at time period 33 due to activities 10, 14, 19, 2, 22, 28, 6 
7: resource 4 is scarce at time period 37 due to activities 10, 14, 19, 2, 22, 28, 29, 6 
8: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
9: activity 22 must be completed 
10: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 30 
11: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
12: extends the length of the project beyond time period 47
