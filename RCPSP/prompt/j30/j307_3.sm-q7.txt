PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution:

Question: Why is the subset of activities 22, 27 completed at the same time period? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 22, 27 is completed at the same time period 
1: activity 19 must be completed before starting activity 22 
2: activity 25 must be completed before starting activity 27 
3: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 28 
4: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 30 
5: resource 3 is scarce at time period 36 due to activities 13, 16, 17, 2, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 
6: activity 17 must be completed before starting activity 19 
7: activity 17 must be completed before starting activity 25 
8: activity 25 must be completed before starting activity 26 
9: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 29 
10: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
11: activity 3 must be completed 
12: activity 4 must be completed before starting activity 5 
13: activity 5 must be completed before starting activity 8 
14: activity 8 must be completed before starting activity 9 
15: activity 3 must be completed before starting activity 11 
16: activity 9 must be completed before starting activity 17 
17: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 29 
18: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 31 
19: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
20: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
21: extends the length of the project beyond time period 42 
22: resource 1 is scarce at time period 4 due to activities 3, 4 
23: resource 1 is scarce at time period 14 due to activities 11, 18, 3, 4, 6, 9 
24: activity 4 must be completed 
25: activity 11 must be completed before starting activity 14 
26: activity 14 must be completed before starting activity 21
