PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution:

Question: Why is activity 23 completed at time period 23 instead of activity 6? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 23 completed at time period 23 instead of activity 6 
1: activity 6 must be completed before starting activity 23 
2: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 26 
3: resource 4 is scarce at time period 16 due to activities 11, 18, 24, 3, 6, 8 
4: resource 4 is scarce at time period 23 due to activities 11, 18, 19, 20, 24, 3, 6, 8 
5: resource 1 is scarce at time period 41 due to activities 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 24, 27, 29, 30, 31, 4, 6, 7, 8 
6: resource 2 is scarce at time period 26 due to activities 10, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 25, 26, 3, 5, 7, 8 
7: activity 18 must be completed before starting activity 26 
8: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 29 
9: activity 18 must be completed 
10: activity 24 must be completed 
11: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 25 
12: activity 20 must be completed 
13: activity 20 must be completed before starting activity 22 
14: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 28 
15: activity 25 must be completed before starting activity 30 
16: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 31 
17: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
18: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
19: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
20: extends the length of the project beyond time period 44
