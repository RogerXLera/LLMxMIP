PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 23       | 22         | 28              | 7        | 7, 15        | 3             | 2              | 
| 28       | 29         | 32              | 4        | 23           | 2             | 6              | 
| 30       | 34         | 43              | 10       | 5, 22, 28    | 3             | 9              | 
| 32       | 43         | 43              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is activity 23 not completed at time period 150? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 23 is not completed at time period 150 
1: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 28 
2: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 30 
3: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
4: extends the length of the project beyond time period 43 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
