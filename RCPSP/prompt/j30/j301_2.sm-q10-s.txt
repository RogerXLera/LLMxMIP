PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units |

Question: Why is activity 19 completed at time period 24 instead of activity 14? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 19 completed at time period 24 instead of activity 14 
1: activity 7 must be completed 
2: activity 16 must be completed 
3: activity 17 must be completed 
4: activity 18 must be completed 
5: activity 28 must be completed 
6: activity 7 must be completed before starting activity 11 
7: activity 18 must be completed before starting activity 23 
8: activity 11 must be completed before starting activity 26 
9: activity 16 must be completed before starting activity 26 
10: activity 17 must be completed before starting activity 26 
11: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 27 
12: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 30 
13: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 30 
14: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 31 
15: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32

17: resource 1 is scarce at time period 18 due to activities 10, 11, 16, 18, 22, 5 
18: resource 1 is scarce at time period 24 due to activities 10, 11, 16, 18, 22, 23, 28, 5 
19: resource 1 is scarce at time period 28 due to activities 10, 11, 16, 18, 22, 23, 26, 28, 5 
20: resource 1 is scarce at time period 30 due to activities 10, 11, 16, 18, 22, 23, 26, 28, 5 
21: resource 1 is scarce at time period 33 due to activities 10, 11, 16, 18, 22, 23, 26, 28, 5 
22: resource 1 is scarce at time period 37 due to activities 10, 11, 16, 18, 22, 23, 26, 28, 5 
23: resource 3 is scarce at time period 13 due to activities 12, 17, 2, 4, 7 
24: resource 3 is scarce at time period 23 due to activities 12, 14, 17, 2, 4, 7 
25: extends the length of the project beyond time period 47
