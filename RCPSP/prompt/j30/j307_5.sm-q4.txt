PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units |

Question: Why is activity 25 not completed after time period 35? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 25 is not completed after time period 35 
1: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 25 
2: activity 25 must be completed before starting activity 30 
3: activity 24 must be completed 
4: resource 1 is scarce at time period 40 due to activities 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 24, 27, 29, 30, 31, 4, 6, 7, 8 
5: resource 1 is scarce at time period 41 due to activities 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 24, 27, 29, 30, 31, 4, 6, 7, 8 
6: resource 4 is scarce at time period 15 due to activities 11, 18, 24, 3, 6, 8 
7: resource 4 is scarce at time period 18 due to activities 11, 18, 19, 24, 3, 6, 8 
8: resource 4 is scarce at time period 25 due to activities 11, 18, 19, 20, 24, 26, 3, 6, 8 
9: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
10: activity 6 must be completed 
11: activity 31 must be completed 
12: activity 6 must be completed before starting activity 23 
13: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 29 
14: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
15: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
16: activity 18 must be completed 
17: activity 18 must be completed before starting activity 26 
18: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 26 
19: extends the length of the project beyond time period 44
