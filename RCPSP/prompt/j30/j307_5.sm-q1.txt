PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution:

8: activity 24 must be completed 
9: resource 1 is scarce at time period 40 due to activities 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 24, 27, 29, 30, 31, 4, 6, 7, 8 
10: resource 1 is scarce at time period 41 due to activities 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 24, 27, 29, 30, 31, 4, 6, 7, 8 
11: resource 4 is scarce at time period 16 due to activities 11, 18, 24, 3, 6, 8 
12: resource 4 is scarce at time period 17 due to activities 11, 18, 24, 3, 6, 8 
13: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
14: activity 18 must be completed 
15: activity 20 must be completed 
16: activity 20 must be completed before starting activity 22 
17: activity 6 must be completed before starting activity 23 
18: activity 18 must be completed before starting activity 26 
19: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 26 
20: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 29 
21: activity 6 must be completed 
22: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 28 
23: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 31 
24: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
25: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
26: extends the length of the project beyond time period 44
