PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|

Question: Why is the subset of activities 20, 18 not completed at the same time period? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 20, 18 is not completed at the same time period 
1: activity 16 must be completed 
2: activity 18 must be completed 
3: activity 19 must be completed 
4: activity 18 must be completed before starting activity 23 
5: activity 19 must be completed before starting activity 26 
6: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 27 
7: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 29 
8: activity 16 must be completed before starting activity 30 
9: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 31 
10: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
11: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
12: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
13: resource 1 is scarce at time period 24 due to activities 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 2, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 
14: resource 1 is scarce at time period 34 due to activities 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 2, 20, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 3, 30, 31, 4, 5, 7, 8 
15: resource 1 is scarce at time period 36 due to activities 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 2, 20, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 3, 30, 31, 4, 5, 7, 8 
16: resource 1 is scarce at time period 38 due to activities 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 2, 20, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 3, 30, 31, 4, 5, 7, 8 
17: resource 2 is scarce at time period 16 due to activities 12, 15, 18, 19, 20, 28, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 
18: resource 2 is scarce at time period 20 due to activities 12, 15, 18, 19, 20, 25, 28, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
