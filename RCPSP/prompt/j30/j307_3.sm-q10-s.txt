PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution:

Question: Why is activity 25 completed at time period 30 instead of activity 16? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 25 completed at time period 30 instead of activity 16 
1: activity 3 must be completed 
2: activity 4 must be completed 
3: activity 4 must be completed before starting activity 5 
4: activity 5 must be completed before starting activity 8 
5: activity 8 must be completed before starting activity 9 
6: activity 3 must be completed before starting activity 11 
7: activity 11 must be completed before starting activity 14 
8: activity 9 must be completed before starting activity 17 
9: activity 17 must be completed before starting activity 19 
10: activity 14 must be completed before starting activity 21 
11: activity 19 must be completed before starting activity 22 
12: activity 17 must be completed before starting activity 25 
13: activity 25 must be completed before starting activity 26 
14: activity 25 must be completed before starting activity 27 
15: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 28 
16: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 29 
17: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 29 
18: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 30 
19: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 31 
20: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
21: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
22: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
23: resource 1 is scarce at time period 4 due to activities 3, 4 
24: resource 1 is scarce at time period 14 due to activities 11, 18, 3, 4, 6, 9 
25: resource 3 is scarce at time period 36 due to activities 13, 16, 17, 2, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 
26: extends the length of the project beyond time period 42 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
