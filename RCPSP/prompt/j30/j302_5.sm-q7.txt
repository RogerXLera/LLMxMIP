PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 21       | 25         | 32              | 8        | 10, 13       | 4             | 5              | 
| 24       | 43         | 50              | 8        | 5, 20        | 4             | 7              | 
| 26       | 39         | 48              | 10       | 20, 21, 23   | 3             | 1              | 
| 27       | 34         | 42              | 9        | 19, 22       | 4             | 5              | 
| 28       | 49         | 49              | 1        | 18, 26       | 3             | 8              | 
| 30       | 43         | 51              | 9        | 17, 25, 27   | 1             | 2              | 
| 31       | 51         | 51              | 1        | 24, 25, 28   | 2             | 6              | 
| 32       | 51         | 51              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is the subset of activities 30, 31, 32 completed at the same time period? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 30, 31, 32 is completed at the same time period 
1: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 30 
2: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 31 
3: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 31 
4: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
5: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
6: extends the length of the project beyond time period 51 
7: activity 27 must be completed 
8: resource 4 is scarce at time period 34 due to activities 21, 24, 27, 6 
9: resource 4 is scarce at time period 42 due to activities 21, 24, 27, 6 
10: activity 24 must be completed 
11: resource 4 is scarce at time period 26 due to activities 21, 24, 6 
12: resource 4 is scarce at time period 31 due to activities 21, 24, 6 
13: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 28 
14: activity 21 must be completed 
15: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 26
