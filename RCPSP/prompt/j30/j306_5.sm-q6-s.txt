PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution:

Question: Why is the subset of activities 13, 7 not completed at time period 31? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 13, 7 is not completed at time period 31 
1: activity 7 must be completed before starting activity 10 
2: activity 10 must be completed before starting activity 19 
3: activity 7 must be completed before starting activity 21 
4: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 22 
5: activity 19 must be completed before starting activity 23 
6: activity 7 must be completed before starting activity 24 
7: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 25 
8: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 26 
9: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 27 
10: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 28 
11: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 29 
12: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 29 
13: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 30 
14: activity 25 must be completed before starting activity 31 
15: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 31 
16: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
17: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
18: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
19: resource 3 is scarce at time period 38 due to activities 10, 15, 17, 18, 19, 22, 24, 25, 3, 4, 5, 7 
20: resource 3 is scarce at time period 43 due to activities 10, 15, 17, 18, 19, 22, 24, 25, 3, 30, 4, 5, 7 
21: resource 3 is scarce at time period 45 due to activities 10, 15, 17, 18, 19, 22, 24, 25, 27, 3, 30, 4, 5, 7 
22: resource 3 is scarce at time period 46 due to activities 10, 15, 17, 18, 19, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 3, 30, 4, 5, 7 
23: resource 3 is scarce at time period 50 due to activities 10, 15, 17, 18, 19, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 3, 30, 4, 5, 7 
24: resource 3 is scarce at time period 51 due to activities 10, 15, 17, 18, 19, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 3, 30, 4, 5, 7 
25: resource 3 is scarce at time period 58 due to activities 10, 15, 17, 18, 19, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 3, 30, 4, 5, 7 
26: resource 3 is scarce at time period 60 due to activities 10, 15, 17, 18, 19, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 3, 30, 4, 5, 7 
27: extends the length of the project beyond time period 67
