PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 11       | 14         | 21              | 8        | 9            | 1             | 9              | 
| 14       | 19         | 21              | 3        | 8            | 4             | 6              | 
| 17       | 22         | 23              | 2        | 3, 11        | 3             | 3              | 
Question: Why is the subset of activities 17, 11, 14 not completed at the same time period? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 17, 11, 14 is not completed at the same time period 
1: activity 17 must be completed 
2: activity 11 must be completed before starting activity 17 
3: extends the length of the project beyond time period 47 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason. 

OUTPUT:
