PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|

Question: Why is activity 14 completed at time period 17 instead of activity 15? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 14 completed at time period 17 instead of activity 15 
1: activity 7 must be completed 
2: activity 11 must be completed 
3: activity 14 must be completed 
4: activity 15 must be completed 
5: activity 7 must be completed before starting activity 15 
6: activity 14 must be completed before starting activity 19 
7: activity 19 must be completed before starting activity 21 
8: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 22 
9: activity 11 must be completed before starting activity 27 
10: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 29 
11: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 30 
12: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
13: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
14: resource 2 is scarce at time period 37 due to activities 10, 16, 20, 25, 29, 3, 30 
15: resource 2 is scarce at time period 38 due to activities 10, 16, 20, 25, 29, 3, 30 
16: resource 3 is scarce at time period 9 due to activities 14, 2, 7 
17: resource 3 is scarce at time period 12 due to activities 11, 14, 2, 7 
18: resource 3 is scarce at time period 18 due to activities 11, 14, 2, 7 
19: extends the length of the project beyond time period 38 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
