PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|

Question: Why is activity 25 not completed after time period 35? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 25 is not completed after time period 35 
1: activity 6 must be completed 
2: activity 18 must be completed 
3: activity 24 must be completed 
4: activity 31 must be completed 
5: activity 6 must be completed before starting activity 23 
6: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 25 
7: activity 18 must be completed before starting activity 26 
8: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 26 
9: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 29 
10: activity 25 must be completed before starting activity 30 
11: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
12: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
13: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
14: resource 1 is scarce at time period 40 due to activities 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 24, 27, 29, 30, 31, 4, 6, 7, 8 
15: resource 1 is scarce at time period 41 due to activities 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 24, 27, 29, 30, 31, 4, 6, 7, 8 
16: resource 4 is scarce at time period 15 due to activities 11, 18, 24, 3, 6, 8 
17: resource 4 is scarce at time period 18 due to activities 11, 18, 19, 24, 3, 6, 8 
18: resource 4 is scarce at time period 25 due to activities 11, 18, 19, 20, 24, 26, 3, 6, 8 
19: extends the length of the project beyond time period 44
