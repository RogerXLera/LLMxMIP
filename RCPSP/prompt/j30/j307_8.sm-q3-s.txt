PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution:

9: activity 10 must be completed before starting activity 11 
10: activity 7 must be completed before starting activity 13 
11: activity 9 must be completed before starting activity 14 
12: activity 11 must be completed before starting activity 16 
13: activity 13 must be completed before starting activity 16 
14: activity 14 must be completed before starting activity 17 
15: activity 16 must be completed before starting activity 18 
16: activity 8 must be completed before starting activity 19

21: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 30 
22: activity 18 must be completed before starting activity 31 
23: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 31 
24: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
25: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
26: resource 1 is scarce at time period 19 due to activities 12, 13, 15, 17, 2, 27, 6, 8 
27: resource 2 is scarce at time period 7 due to activities 15, 4, 7, 9 
28: resource 2 is scarce at time period 11 due to activities 14, 15, 4, 5, 7, 9 
29: resource 3 is scarce at time period 24 due to activities 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 2, 28, 3, 4, 7, 8 
30: resource 3 is scarce at time period 27 due to activities 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 2, 28, 3, 4, 7, 8 
31: resource 3 is scarce at time period 32 due to activities 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 2, 22, 28, 3, 4, 7, 8
