PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution:

6: resource 3 is scarce at time period 36 due to activities 13, 16, 17, 2, 20, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 
7: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 31 
8: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 30 
9: activity 8 must be completed before starting activity 9 
10: resource 1 is scarce at time period 14 due to activities 11, 18, 3, 4, 6, 9 
11: activity 19 must be completed before starting activity 22 
12: activity 3 must be completed 
13: activity 4 must be completed before starting activity 5 
14: activity 5 must be completed before starting activity 8 
15: activity 3 must be completed before starting activity 11 
16: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 28 
17: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 29 
18: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 29 
19: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
20: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
21: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
22: activity 4 must be completed 
23: activity 11 must be completed before starting activity 14 
24: resource 1 is scarce at time period 4 due to activities 3, 4 
25: activity 14 must be completed before starting activity 21 
26: extends the length of the project beyond time period 42
