PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 5        | 6          | 12              | 7        | 4            | 1             | 4              |

| 26       | 18         | 21              | 4        | 12, 13, 15   | 1             | 1              | 
| 29       | 23         | 32              | 10       | 6, 19, 26    | 1             | 10             |

| 32       | 51         | 51              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is activity 26 completed at time period 21 instead of activity 18? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 26 completed at time period 21 instead of activity 18 
1: activity 12 must be completed before starting activity 26 
2: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 29 
3: resource 1 is scarce at time period 12 due to activities 10, 18, 3, 5 
4: resource 1 is scarce at time period 16 due to activities 10, 13, 18, 3, 5 
5: activity 5 must be completed before starting activity 12 
6: resource 1 is scarce at time period 42 due to activities 10, 13, 18, 26, 28, 29, 3, 30, 5 
7: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
8: activity 5 must be completed 
9: activity 30 must be completed 
10: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
11: extends the length of the project beyond time period 51
