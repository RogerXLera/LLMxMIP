PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units |

Question: Why is activity 16 completed at time period 23 instead of activity 12? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 16 completed at time period 23 instead of activity 12 
1: activity 4 must be completed 
2: activity 11 must be completed 
3: activity 11 must be completed before starting activity 12 
4: activity 4 must be completed before starting activity 18 
5: activity 18 must be completed before starting activity 23 
6: activity 12 must be completed before starting activity 25 
7: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 26
