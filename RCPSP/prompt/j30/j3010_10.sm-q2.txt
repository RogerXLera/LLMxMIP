PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 28       | 34         | 35              | 2        | 7, 21, 26    | 1             | 8              | 
| 31       | 36         | 41              | 6        | 5, 27, 28    | 1             | 7              | 
| 32       | 41         | 41              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is activity 28 not completed at time period 81? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 28 is not completed at time period 81 
1: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 31 
2: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
3: extends the length of the project beyond time period 41
