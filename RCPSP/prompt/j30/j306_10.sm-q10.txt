PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution:

18: activity 14 must be completed 
19: activity 15 must be completed 
20: activity 17 must be completed before starting activity 19
