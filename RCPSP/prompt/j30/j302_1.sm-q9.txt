PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution:

Question: Why is activity 25 completed at time period 32 instead of time period 31? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 25 is completed at time period 32 instead of time period 31 
1: activity 25 must be completed 
2: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 25 
3: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 23 
4: activity 19 must be completed before starting activity 21 
5: activity 14 must be completed before starting activity 19 
6: activity 14 must be completed 
7: resource 3 is scarce at time period 9 due to activities 14, 2, 7 
8: resource 3 is scarce at time period 11 due to activities 14, 2, 7 
9: resource 3 is scarce at time period 15 due to activities 11, 14, 2, 7 
10: activity 7 must be completed 
11: activity 7 must be completed before starting activity 15 
12: activity 11 must be completed 
13: activity 11 must be completed before starting activity 27 
14: activity 15 must be completed before starting activity 22 
15: resource 1 is scarce at time period 25 due to activities 15, 26, 27, 6, 8 
16: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 29 
17: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 30 
18: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
19: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
20: extends the length of the project beyond time period 38
