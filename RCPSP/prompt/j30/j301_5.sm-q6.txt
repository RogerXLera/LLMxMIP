PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution:

14: activity 8 must be completed 
15: activity 9 must be completed 
16: activity 19 must be completed 
17: activity 27 must be completed 
18: activity 8 must be completed before starting activity 10 
19: activity 9 must be completed before starting activity 13
