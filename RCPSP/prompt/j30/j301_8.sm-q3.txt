PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 9        | 21         | 25              | 5        | 2            | 2             | 8              |

| 21       | 36         | 45              | 10       | 18           | 2             | 2              |

| 29       | 46         | 53              | 8        | 11, 21, 27   | 2             | 10             |

Question: Why is activity 23 not completed before time period 26? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 23 is not completed before time period 26 
1: activity 23 must be completed 
2: activity 9 must be completed before starting activity 23 
3: resource 2 is scarce at time period 15 due to activities 14, 23, 25, 3, 4, 5, 9 
4: resource 2 is scarce at time period 20 due to activities 14, 23, 25, 27, 3, 4, 5, 9 
5: activity 9 must be completed 
6: resource 2 is scarce at time period 11 due to activities 14, 25, 3, 4, 5, 9 
7: activity 14 must be completed 
8: activity 14 must be completed before starting activity 16 
9: activity 16 must be completed before starting activity 18 
10: activity 18 must be completed before starting activity 21 
11: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 29 
12: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
13: extends the length of the project beyond time period 53
