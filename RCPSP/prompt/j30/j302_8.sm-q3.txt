PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 12       | 33         | 39              | 7        | 9            | 4             | 8              |

| 27       | 33         | 42              | 10       | 21, 23       | 1             | 10             |

| 30       | 52         | 54              | 3        | 11, 26, 28   | 2             | 7              |

| 32       | 54         | 54              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is activity 32 not completed before time period 54? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 32 is not completed before time period 54 
1: activity 32 must be completed 
2: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
3: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
4: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 30 
5: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 31 
6: resource 1 is scarce at time period 46 due to activities 10, 13, 27, 28, 29, 3, 31 
7: resource 1 is scarce at time period 50 due to activities 10, 13, 27, 28, 29, 3, 31 
8: activity 25 must be completed before starting activity 28 
9: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 27 
10: activity 18 must be completed before starting activity 25 
11: activity 23 must be completed 
12: resource 4 is scarce at time period 31 due to activities 11, 12, 14, 20, 23, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 
13: activity 12 must be completed before starting activity 18 
14: activity 12 must be completed
