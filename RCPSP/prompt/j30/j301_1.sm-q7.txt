PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 16       | 14         | 23              | 10       | 10           | 4             | 5              | 
| 17       | 24         | 29              | 6        | 13, 14       | 4             | 8              | 
| 22       | 30         | 36              | 7        | 16, 17, 18   | 1             | 2              | 
| 23       | 37         | 38              | 2        | 20, 22       | 1             | 3              | 
| 24       | 39         | 41              | 3        | 19, 23       | 2             | 9              | 
| 30       | 42         | 43              | 2        | 6, 24, 25    | 2             | 7              | 
| 32       | 43         | 43              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is the subset of activities 30, 32 completed at the same time period? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 30, 32 is completed at the same time period 
1: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 30 
2: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
3: extends the length of the project beyond time period 43 
4: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 24 
5: activity 22 must be completed before starting activity 23 
6: activity 16 must be completed before starting activity 22 
7: activity 17 must be completed before starting activity 22 
8: activity 16 must be completed 
9: resource 4 is scarce at time period 23 due to activities 10, 16, 17, 18, 27, 4, 6 
10: activity 17 must be completed
