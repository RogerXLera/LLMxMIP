PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 29       | 47         | 55              | 9        | 18, 27       | 1             | 5              | 
| 32       | 56         | 56              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is activity 29 not completed at time period 103? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 29 is not completed at time period 103 
1: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
2: extends the length of the project beyond time period 56 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
