PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|

| 32       | 51         | 51              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is the subset of activities 18, 12, 13 not completed at time period 25? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 18, 12, 13 is not completed at time period 25 
1: resource 1 is scarce at time period 23 due to activities 10, 11, 12, 18, 2, 21, 22, 25, 26, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 
2: activity 10 must be completed 
3: activity 10 must be completed before starting activity 17 
4: activity 17 must be completed before starting activity 23 
5: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 24 
6: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 27 
7: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 29 
8: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
9: extends the length of the project beyond time period 51
