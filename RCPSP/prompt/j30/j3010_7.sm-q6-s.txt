PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|

Question: Why is the subset of activities 17, 11 not completed at time period 31? 
Reasons: 
0: The subset of activities 17, 11 is not completed at time period 31 
1: activity 15 must be completed 
2: activity 24 must be completed 
3: activity 26 must be completed 
4: activity 15 must be completed before starting activity 19 
5: activity 19 must be completed before starting activity 25 
6: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 28 
7: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 28 
8: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 29 
9: activity 25 must be completed before starting activity 30 
10: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
11: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
12: resource 3 is scarce at time period 23 due to activities 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 2, 20, 22, 24, 26, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 
13: resource 3 is scarce at time period 29 due to activities 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 2, 20, 22, 24, 26, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 
14: resource 3 is scarce at time period 30 due to activities 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 2, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 
15: extends the length of the project beyond time period 49 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
