PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 8        | 10         | 18              | 9        | 4, 5         | 2             | 5              | 
| 10       | 19         | 26              | 8        | 7            | 2             | 10             | 
| 13       | 27         | 35              | 9        | 8, 10        | 3             | 10             | 
| 20       | 36         | 45              | 10       | 13           | 1             | 3              | 
| 30       | 49         | 53              | 5        | 11, 20, 26   | 4             | 7              | 
| 31       | 46         | 53              | 8        | 17, 21, 23   | 1             | 10             | 
| 32       | 53         | 53              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is activity 23 completed at time period 25 instead of activity 10? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 23 completed at time period 25 instead of activity 10 
1: activity 8 must be completed 
2: activity 31 must be completed 
3: activity 8 must be completed before starting activity 13 
4: activity 13 must be completed before starting activity 20 
5: activity 20 must be completed before starting activity 30 
6: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
7: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
8: resource 1 is scarce at time period 39 due to activities 15, 20, 27, 31, 4, 6, 9 
9: resource 1 is scarce at time period 46 due to activities 15, 20, 27, 31, 4, 6, 9 
10: resource 2 is scarce at time period 18 due to activities 10, 7, 8 
11: extends the length of the project beyond time period 53 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
