PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution:

10: resource 2 is scarce at time period 22 due to activities 13, 15, 20, 24, 25, 26, 8 
11: resource 2 is scarce at time period 23 due to activities 13, 15, 20, 24, 25, 26, 8 
12: resource 2 is scarce at time period 28 due to activities 13, 15, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 8 
13: activity 3 must be completed before starting activity 11 
14: activity 7 must be completed before starting activity 13 
15: activity 20 must be completed before starting activity 29 
16: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 27 
17: activity 24 must be completed 
18: activity 24 must be completed before starting activity 27 
19: activity 27 must be completed before starting activity 28 
20: activity 3 must be completed 
21: resource 1 is scarce at time period 2 due to activities 3, 4 
22: resource 1 is scarce at time period 4 due to activities 3, 4, 5 
23: resource 1 is scarce at time period 6 due to activities 3, 4, 5, 9 
24: activity 4 must be completed before starting activity 7 
25: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
26: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 30
