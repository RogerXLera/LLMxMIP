PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 5        | 6          | 12              | 7        | 4            | 1             | 4              | 
| 12       | 13         | 17              | 5        | 5            | 2             | 1              | 
| 18       | 13         | 22              | 10       | 2, 9         | 1             | 10             | 
| 26       | 18         | 21              | 4        | 12, 13, 15   | 1             | 1              | 
| 29       | 23         | 32              | 10       | 6, 19, 26    | 1             | 10             | 
| 30       | 42         | 51              | 10       | 16, 27, 28   | 1             | 4              | 
| 32       | 51         | 51              | 0        | 29, 30, 31   | -             | -              | 
Question: Why is activity 26 completed at time period 21 instead of activity 18? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 26 completed at time period 21 instead of activity 18 
1: activity 5 must be completed 
2: activity 30 must be completed 
3: activity 5 must be completed before starting activity 12 
4: activity 12 must be completed before starting activity 26 
5: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 29 
6: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
7: activity 30 must be completed before starting activity 32 
8: resource 1 is scarce at time period 12 due to activities 10, 18, 3, 5 
9: resource 1 is scarce at time period 16 due to activities 10, 13, 18, 3, 5 
10: resource 1 is scarce at time period 42 due to activities 10, 13, 18, 26, 28, 29, 3, 30, 5 
11: extends the length of the project beyond time period 51 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
