PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. Moreover, such reasons are connected to each other like nodes in a graph. Use the reasons and their connections to write the explanation. 
Solution:

6: resource 2 is scarce at time period 43 due to activities 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 28, 29, 8 
7: resource 4 is scarce at time period 10 due to activities 10, 11, 17, 18, 19, 2, 5 
8: resource 4 is scarce at time period 14 due to activities 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 19, 2, 22, 5 
9: activity 14 must be completed before starting activity 20 
10: activity 14 must be completed before starting activity 28 
11: activity 2 must be completed 
12: activity 3 must be completed 
13: activity 3 must be completed before starting activity 5 
14: activity 2 must be completed before starting activity 12 
15: activity 12 must be completed before starting activity 26 
16: activity 20 must be completed before starting activity 29 
17: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 29 
18: activity 28 must be completed before starting activity 31 
19: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
20: resource 1 is scarce at time period 4 due to activities 19, 2, 3, 4, 6 
21: resource 1 is scarce at time period 7 due to activities 11, 16, 17, 19, 2, 3, 4, 6 
22: activity 31 must be completed before starting activity 32 
23: extends the length of the project beyond time period 53
