PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------| 
| 3        | 5          | 13              | 9        | 1            | 1             | 9              | 
| 4        | 1          | 4               | 4        | 1            | 1             | 4              | 
| 5        | 14         | 23              | 10       | 3            | 3             | 7              | 
| 7        | 24         | 30              | 7        | 5            | 1             | 10             | 
| 12       | 5          | 13              | 9        | 4            | 4             | 2              | 
| 18       | 20         | 28              | 9        | 12           | 2             | 2              | 
| 21       | 31         | 38              | 8        | 7, 18        | 1             | 1              | 
Question: Why is activity 21 not completed before time period 38? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 21 is not completed before time period 38 
1: activity 3 must be completed 
2: activity 4 must be completed 
3: activity 21 must be completed 
4: activity 3 must be completed before starting activity 5 
5: activity 5 must be completed before starting activity 7 
6: activity 4 must be completed before starting activity 12 
7: activity 12 must be completed before starting activity 18 
8: activity 7 must be completed before starting activity 21 
9: activity 18 must be completed before starting activity 21 
10: resource 3 is scarce at time period 4 due to activities 3, 4 
11: resource 3 is scarce at time period 8 due to activities 15, 3, 4 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
