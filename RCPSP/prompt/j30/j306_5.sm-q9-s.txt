PROMPT:
The project schedule problem is the problem of finding a schedule of activities that respect some precedence and resource restrictions while minimising the project completion time. In this context, provide an explanation to answer the following question about the solution of 32-activity project schedule problem. To do so, use the reasons below, which are related to the project schedule restrictions. 
Solution: 
| activity | start_time | completion_time | duration | predecessors | resource_type | resource_units | 
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|

Question: Why is activity 25 completed at time period 50 instead of time period 49? 
Reasons: 
0: Activity 25 is completed at time period 50 instead of time period 49 
1: activity 3 must be completed 
2: activity 4 must be completed 
3: activity 25 must be completed 
4: activity 3 must be completed before starting activity 5 
5: activity 5 must be completed before starting activity 7 
6: activity 7 must be completed before starting activity 10 
7: activity 4 must be completed before starting activity 12 
8: activity 12 must be completed before starting activity 18 
9: activity 10 must be completed before starting activity 19 
10: activity 18 must be completed before starting activity 21 
11: activity 19 must be completed before starting activity 23 
12: activity 21 must be completed before starting activity 25 
13: activity 23 must be completed before starting activity 26 
14: activity 26 must be completed before starting activity 29 
15: activity 29 must be completed before starting activity 32 
16: resource 3 is scarce at time period 4 due to activities 3, 4 
17: resource 3 is scarce at time period 8 due to activities 15, 3, 4 
18: resource 3 is scarce at time period 30 due to activities 10, 15, 17, 18, 24, 3, 4, 5, 7 
19: resource 3 is scarce at time period 42 due to activities 10, 15, 17, 18, 19, 22, 24, 25, 3, 30, 4, 5, 7 
20: resource 3 is scarce at time period 46 due to activities 10, 15, 17, 18, 19, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 3, 30, 4, 5, 7 
21: extends the length of the project beyond time period 67 

Write a brief explanation without listing reasons and do not refer to the number of the reason.
